Consider cases, straps, paper-based copies as well as having the device charged and turned on.\n\nA crucial step in the Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) process is setting up environments. We need to make AAC is always available.\n\nThis ensures that AAC users have access to their communication devices. It also means that teams can provide modeling and support on the AAC.\n\nFor AAC users, access to their AAC system is essential. If they wish to communicate what they want, when they want, they must be able to reach that AAC system. AAC should not be in the cupboard or left in a bag - it is too hard to get. AAC users cannot communicate if the battery to their AAC device is flat. If AAC system is only available during morning circle or at McDonalds, this is not useful. Having access to their AAC system is crucial. Everyone should be responsible for making AAC available. And there should always be a plan for when AAC is not available.\n\nIf a person has a physical impairment, we do not take away their walker when they need to walk. If a person has a hearing impairment, we do not take away their hearing aids when they need to hear. So why do we take away a person’s AAC system when they need to talk?\n\nThis article will cover 6 strategies to ensure that AAC is always available for users. Some specific topics will include:\n\nAllowing access to AAC for multimodal communicators\nGiving everyone access to the AAC system\nKeeping the AAC system turned on and charged\nPaper-based AAC options\nUtilizing whiteboards and tv screens, and\nConsidering accessories to keep AAC accessible\n1. Multi-modal communicators\nKeeping AAC available is often complicated for many AAC users. Often they have multiple ways to communicate their messages. In addition to their AAC system, they may use a combination of vocalizations, word approximations, gestures, and sign language. Sometimes, in our fast-moving world, it can be faster and easier to rely on their vocalizations and gestures. We should value and respond to all methods of communication.\n\nBut what happens when that communication fails, when we cannot understand what the individual is trying to tell us? What if the individual has far more to say, than they can communicate with the sounds and gestures alone? Many AAC users need all the words and language in their AAC system all the time. It needs to be there and ready for them to use as soon as they need it.\n\nFor example, Matthew, is an excellent multi-modal communicator. He communicates very effectively using some words and vocalizations, combined with a great repertoire of signs. He uses these methods of communication all day. Often, they give him a fast way to get his message across. However, these things do not work so well with unfamiliar people. Nor does it help him to tell the teacher what he has learnt from the lesson on recycling. It also doesn’t help when Mum has no idea what he is trying to tell her about what happened at school that day. This is when Matthew uses his AAC system. There are many, many times in the day that he uses it because his vocalizations and signing are not always enough!\n\nYoung boy using AAC system on iPad with Proloquo2Go\nMatthew using his AAC system to tell Mum about his school day.\nJust like in Matthew\'s case, we should all consider all the different ways we can communicate.\n\n2. Everyone needs access to AAC!\nBut it is not enough support the communicator to access their AAC system. All of the team need fast and instant access to AAC as well!\n\nA key strategy when we start using AAC is modeling. Modeling means people in the environment point to the words on the AAC system while talking to the AAC learner. When the learner sees people in their environment using the AAC system to communicate, they will learn how they can also use their AAC to communicate. This modeling is more likely to happen when AAC is available and easy to access.\n\nModel Words On Proloquo2Go During Book Time\nModel, point to words on the AAC as you speak.\nRead how Erin started wearing PODD to make it available for her daughter.\n\nWe cannot model if the AAC tool is in the cupboard or out of charge. So strap on AAC and be ready to pick it up and model at any time. Think of how many moments there are in our day where you can model. In Matthew’s case, his team keeps the AAC system out all the time, so they can model words and sentences. They do this whether Matthew is choosing to use the AAC system or not.\n\nRemember it is always important to ask the AAC users permission if you are going to model on their communication device. If possible, keep access to your own AAC and model on that.\n\n3. Turned on and charged\nPut systems in place to ensure that AAC devices are always turned on and charged. Sometimes the AAC system may need to sit in an easy to access location while it is plugged in to charge.\n\nIt is good to work with the communicator so they can become more independent in this area over time. Teach them how to turn the device on and off, including how to enter a password to unlock the iPad if necessary. Show the AAC user how to tell if their battery is low and how they can charge it, or ask for help charging it.\n\n4. Paper-based AAC options\nAnother great way to have consistent access to an AAC system is to use light-tech, paper-based options. We can take screenshots of key pages and then print and laminate them. This can be a great way to have access to the AAC system all the time, especially if something happens to the iPad. It is also helpful in messy, wet or bright situations where the iPad is difficult to use.\n\nPaper AAC during messy play\nUsing a paper communication board during messy play\nYou may even wish to create a book based on the AAC system. For more information, see this blog post on how to create a paper-based book from Proloquo2Go, step-by-step.\n\nYou can print Proloquo2Go Crescendo 7x11 core word boards and posters from the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom. Posters can be attached to walls, outdoor surfaces or anywhere that is easily accessible. Posters are very visible and make AAC constantly available for all to use throughout the day.\n\nIf you are working in an environment with only one iPad, it can be very useful to make some paper-based boards or posters. Some people can model on the iPad while others use the boards.\n\nCore words boards available at a playground and in a classroom\nIf you are using the PODD communication system, then a printed PODD book is an important paper-based solution. Our simPODD app has simple printing capabilities from within the app, so that you can print PODD books easily.\n\n5. Whiteboards/TV screens\nIf the environment has whiteboards or TV screens, we can also use these for AAC. We can mirror an iPad screen onto these larger screens. This is just one more way to make AAC a highly visible part of the environment.\n\n6. Accessories can help to keep the AAC system accessible\nWe should not restrict or limit access to AAC to keep devices “safe”. There are ways to protect devices, so they can be left available to an AAC user. There are also options to help active users keep their AAC devices within reach.\n\n• Cases: Seeing a video of an iOS device being dropped down the stairs or bounced off cement without breaking can reduce anyone\'s fears. There are so many cases available these days, it is impossible to keep up with all of them. And that’s a good thing. AAC users have a variety of choices. They can select a case based on their unique needs and even favorite color! Cases range from soft and squishy to military-grade hardshells. One of the best places to view a wide variety of cases is Lauren Enders’ Pinterest board.\n\n• Straps: For users without mobility limitations, carrying their own device so their voice is with them wherever they go provides ideal access. Some users wear their device with a strap or harness to keep both hands free when not communicating. Other users find using a protective case and a camera strap provides a workable option.\n\n• Harnesses: Younger users might benefit from wearing a harness that holds the device. Harnesses can be more comfortable and distribute the weight of a larger device more evenly.\n\n• Belt-clips: AAC users who use smaller devices can consider a case that fits into a holster that attaches to a belt or a case with a belt-clip.\n\n• Mounts: AAC devices can be mounted on a desk, the counter, or a wheelchair.\n\nThe next step\nWe communicate all day, so we need to ensure that we make AAC always available. Setting up the environment for this is essential for success in the AAC journey.\n\nAnother step in setting up is getting the team on board and planning for AAC throughout the day.'),(15,'Plan for AAC throughout the day\nLook at routines and make a plan for where, when and how AAC can be integrated into the day.\n\nCommunication is always happening. This means there are always opportunities for modeling Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), interacting and building language.\n\nWhen we start out, making a plan for how AAC can be incorporated into the day can be beneficial. Without a plan, AAC may feel overwhelming.\n\nThis article will help us to look at where and when AAC can happen in a day. It will also consider how AAC is incorporated within routines, as well as adapting to unplanned activities and making changes as needed.\n\nWhere can AAC happen?\nAAC can be used anywhere! Plan to take AAC with you wherever you go. Plan to make AAC available during any activity.\n\nWe may need to take into consideration the different environments where AAC will be used. Perhaps the communication device screen cannot be seen in bright sunlight. AAC devices may not always be water-proof, so how can communication happen in the pool or at the beach? How is the AAC device accessed if the AAC user’s hands are busy with something else, for example in bike-riding or horse-riding.\n\nAn alternative in these situations is to use paper-based examples of the AAC system, or to have systems strapped or fixed in easy to access locations.\n\nIt can also be important to plan for situations when AAC is not available. What strategies or tools can be put into place at these times?\n\n5 ways to incorporate AAC\nBuild communication into your daily routines so that working on development of language and communication happens throughout the day.\n\n1. Routines\nOne simple way to start AAC can be to look at everyday routines. What are some activities that happen during a day or week where AAC can be brought into it?\n\nPerhaps the AAC user participates in making lunch every day. During this lunch preparation, there may be many opportunities to chat and discuss what you are doing. It may present opportunities to target particular words or phrases that are part of the AAC user’s current goals. For example, perhaps the AAC user is working on asking for help, so during lunch, you can model “help” when you cannot open the jar (“help open”), when you need the butter from the fridge (“help get”) or when you cannot find the cheese (“help look”), etc.\n\nRoutines can be an easy place to start, as often the language and communication is predictable and familiar. But don’t be afraid to shake routines up now and then! Lots of engagement and commenting can happen when things don’t quite go to plan, or are done differently.\n\nEvery routine should be looked at from time to time. What new words and ideas can we build in? How can we continue repetition of language but provide variety that ensures engagement? In the lunch example, it may mean trying new things to make for lunch, or going out for lunch, or inviting friends over for lunch.\n\nWrite a list of the common routine activities for an AAC user. How can AAC be incorporated? What language could be modelled during these activities? How will you extend and enhance the routine with chances to progress language over time?\n\n2. Transitions\nLooking at routines is just the start. The more often you consider where and when AAC can be incorporated in the day, the more occasions will arise. Soon you may find that as much communication and interaction happens in the transitions between activities as during the activities.\n\n3. Plan for fun\nSometimes the best communication happens when we are having fun. When AAC users are motivated and engaged, there are more opportunities to interact and build language. Don’t wait for fun to happen - plan for it! Look at your routines and find extra ideas and tricks that can be brought into activities to make it fun.\n\n4. Unplanned activities\nEvery now and then, things happen that we did not plan for. This will test both the team and the AAC user to find the words they need to communicate new messages in new situations. Look at it as a great challenge! You may make mistakes as you try to say different messages. The most important thing is that AAC is made available. There is no way to predict what awesome communication opportunities might arise.\n\n5. Social interaction not testing\nBuilding social interaction with AAC should always be a goal. AAC should be used to share news, to chat to friends and to engage in motivating and preferred activities and topics.\n\nWhen AAC is used to test what someone knows, or to answer questions to assessment tasks, it may only make an AAC learner hate their AAC. AAC can be used to do school work, but it should not be the only time it is used.\n\nCan you find time in your day where the focus is on building friendships and conversations, rather than testing or work?\n\nReview plans\nPlans will change over time and it is important to often review the ideas and strategies you have for AAC throughout the day. It is important to always plan for positive change for an AAC user, and this will mean changing and extending plans and goals regularly. You may come back to this step many times in your AAC journey.\n\nThe next step\nMake a plan for AAC and stick to it! This is very important to keep everyone moving forward on the AAC journey. The more you integrate AAC into the day, the easier and more natural it becomes. Soon you will wonder how you ever did anything without AAC!\n\nWith the team on board and some plans in place, it\'s time to start communicating! A great place to start could be by modeling.'),(16,'Start modeling\nModeling means you point to words on the AAC tool as you speak. Model regularly throughout the day. Model different reasons to communicate - not just requests. Model in conversations and natural interactions.\n\nOnce you have set up for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), it is time to get started. The most valuable strategy we can use for AAC learners is Modeling. Modeling is also sometimes called Aided Language Stimulation, Aided Language Input, or Natural Aided Language.\n\nModeling is a strategy that should be used throughout the AAC journey. Once we learn to model, it will be something we will use regularly to support the AAC learner to learn language.\n\nThis article will talk about the specifics of modeling and how we can do it to best support the language development of an AAC user. It will also cover some tips and tricks when modeling and how to overcome any challenges or concerns.\n\nWhat is modeling?\nModeling means that we use the AAC system to talk to the AAC user.\nAll AAC learners need to see what it looks like, to communicate using their AAC system in real conversations.\n\nWe point to words or press words on the AAC system as we speak.\nBy modeling words in everyday situations, we help an AAC user to learn what these words mean. It is a way to show an AAC user where words are in the AAC system and how they can be combined to create messages.\n\nStart small\nWhen we first start modeling, it can be difficult and feel clumsy. But remember to just give it a go: any modeling is better than none! We start small and build up our skills at modeling each day. Focus on a few words to model at a time. Every time we model, it will get easier. The most important thing is to start!\n\nWhy is modeling so important?\nAAC users need to see their AAC system in use. We don’t expect any child to learn to talk without seeing or hearing the adults around him talking. Nor should we expect someone who needs AAC to figure out how to use their AAC system, without seeing others using the system to communicate. When we model, the AAC users sees their AAC system being used to communicate real messages in real situations. An AAC user needs a great amount of input before we can expect them to use AAC reliably.\n\nWhen an AAC system is “not working” for a user, the team should look closely at their modeling. It can be a lack of modeling that is affecting progress and success of communication.\n\nIllustration with people in front of a big iPad pointing at symbols and a big arrow coming\nWhen we model, the AAC users sees their AAC system being used to communicate real messages in real situations.\nMore questions about modeling\nWho should model?\nAll team members should model with an AAC user. Even peers, class mates and siblings can model AAC. Teams working together to model will bring more opportunities and success for the AAC user. Support and encourage everyone on the team to be comfortable and confident with modeling.\n\nWhen do you model?\nModeling can happen anytime, especially when AAC is always available. You can model all the time, not just during speech, snack, or morning circle. Any time you would talk to other learners, you can also model to a person using AAC. Modeling real messages in natural interactions and conversations is a valuable way for AAC users to see the power of meaningful communication.\n\nHow often should we model?\nWe must model as often as we can! Think about how long it will take the AAC user to learn how to use their AAC system if we only show them for a few moments a day or week?\n\nWhat system can you model on?\nThere are no right or wrong answers here. We should model on the AAC system that is available. We may model on the high-tech system or a light-tech variation of it. We may model on a class sized poster.\n\nTeacher Pointing To Model Words On Core Word Poster In Classroom\nTeacher is pointing to words on a core word poster to model in a classroom.\nIf the AAC user allows, you can model on their system. Of course, it is best to model on a system that closely resembles the system the AAC user uses - that way, the user is seeing the same symbols and navigation he or she will need to use. However, it may not always be possible to use an identical system. You may be modeling for a class full of students using different systems. Or you may not be able to afford two of the same high tech system. In these cases, use what you have available, and follow up when possible on the AAC user’s own system. This may help him “map” what you’ve modeled on your system onto the location, so he can find it on his own system.\n\nHow many words do we model?\nTypically, we match our modeling to the language level of the AAC user; meaning we model one or more words than the AAC user is currently using.\n\nIf an AAC user is just starting out, they may not yet be using any words on the AAC system. Perhaps they have started pointing to one word at a time. For these AAC learners, you might model single words, with some 2-3 word sentences.\nFor AAC users that are beginning to use 1-2 word combinations on their AAC system, try modeling 3-6 word sentences.\nThen for AAC users are already producing many different messages on their AAC system, we can model longer sentences. We can also show them how to join ideas or even model grammar and complex sentence structures.\nWhat words do we model?\nWe can model both core and fringe words on our balanced AAC system. We can model specific or general words that will be powerful and effective for an AAC user, within an activity. We can model different words to help them communicate for different reasons. We must give AAC users the chance to learn the words to do more than request. We should model comments and thoughts, rather than just asking lots of questions.\n\nIt is most important to select words that are both meaningful and motivating to the AAC user. Model words and word combinations that will occur often, so there are many opportunities for the AAC user to see them modeled.\n\nThe AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom was developed to help teams find words that can be modeled across a variety of situations. Please join the classroom today for many useful ideas in the Core Word Planners on what words we can model.\nModeling in PODD\nWe also show words and language when modeling using PODD. There are specific strategies for how you can model with either a paper or digital PODD, using simPODD. Learn more about how you can use simPODD to talk together.\n\nModeling key words, not full sentences and grammar\nWhen we start out, we don’t need to model every single word we say. We may not model the exact correct grammar.\n\nInstead, we focus on modeling the key words in a sentence. We target the most important words needed to convey the meaning of the message. If I model this sentence : “ I GO SHOP GET BANANAS”, even though it is not grammatically complete, the general message of the sentence can be understood. Especially if I say it as I am telling my friend about my morning.\n\nKey words is a powerful way to demonstrate how we start combining words to build sentences and language, without the demands of having to know the grammar. Unfortunately when we first start modeling, we can become worried about not demonstrating correct grammar.\n\nModeling key words before full grammatical sentences makes sense - this is how the AAC user will develop their language. They are likely to say and communicate to us in key words, before they start composing sentences, much the same as how all people develop language! In time and with more modeling, they can develop the ability for more precise grammar, as long as they have an AAC system that allows for this grammatical development.\n\nGive a correct verbal model\nWhen you are modeling on the AAC system, it is okay to use the AAC system to model 1-2 words (or however many are needed), while speaking the complete sentence aloud. For example, you could model on the AAC system “I go shop get bananas”, while saying “I went to the shops to get the bananas” with speech.\n\nModel correct grammar\nIt is also okay to model the correct grammar at the right time for the AAC user. For example, if the AAC users says “I go shops” on their AAC system to talk about the weekend, then this may be a perfect opportunity to model. We can show how to use grammar supports to find the word “went”, or to model little words like “to” and “the” on the AAC system. Model \"Really?; you went to the shops on the weekend!?\".\n\nRemember, you’re modeling the next step the AAC user needs to learn.\n\n8 common problems when modeling\nLet’s look at some common challenges when modeling, and possible solutions.\n\n1. Stuck modeling every word\nSometimes we can get stuck if we try to model every word that we say. This makes modeling overwhelming. Just point to the key words in the sentence, not every word.\n\n2. Making mistakes when modeling\nOften we make mistakes when we model. We point to the wrong word. It is fine to show an AAC user that we all get it wrong sometimes when we are talking! The more you model, the easier it will get. Just keep going.\n\n3. AAC user not looking\nSometimes the AAC user may not be looking at you or the AAC system directly when you are modeling. This doesn’t matter. All learners take in information in different ways. Some learners cannot look and listen at the same time. Others, use peripheral vision to watch modeling. Still others may only be able to watch us part of the time. Incidental learning can happen over time, even without focused attention. We should keep modeling even if the AAC user isn’t looking - this keeps us in the habit of modeling, and gives us more practice finding words.\n\nModel Words On Proloquo2Go During Book Time\nModeling words on Proloquo2Go during story time.\n4. AAC user does not respond\nOften an AAC user may not respond to the model that has been provided. One of the hardest things we need to learn to do as we model, is to model without expecting anything in return. We may model a word for an AAC user. Then we can pause to give them time to take up their turn. If they do not respond, we can model the next words and continue the activity. Some AAC users need to see and hear words many times before we can expect them to use them to communicate with us.\n\n5. Stuck modeling requests\nOften we get stuck modeling the language of requests, eg. “I want__”. There is so much more to communication than simply asking for things. It is important that we model language to communicate different messages for different reasons.\n\n6. AAC user does not need to copy\nAn AAC user does not have to copy or repeat the words you have modeled. They can listen and see your words, but they don’t need to repeat them. Look for engaging and fun ways to give them a chance to say something in motivating activities, rather than demanding they copy you.\n\n7. Don’t stop modeling\nAs an AAC user starts using the AAC system more independently, often we see modeling around them stop or decrease. Don’t stop modeling! Instead, start modeling longer sentences. Start modeling grammar. Start modeling language for different communication functions.\n\n8. One model is not enough\nOne model is not enough. We may need to model a word or word combination many times before the AAC user should be expected to use it. Model and then model again!\n\nDocumenting how modeling works best for each individual AAC user will help all team members model most effectively. We know that modeling takes time and practice, but the benefits are great.\n\nStart modeling\nModeling is part of the AAC journey that will be ongoing. Modeling is a key strategy to help an AAC user learn language and real communication. Start modeling today.'),(17,'Activity-specific vs using balanced vocabulary\nUse core words and fringe folders, rather than creating activity boards for everything.\n\nWe are starting Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). We have begun personalizing the vocabulary. Now we also need to think about other ways to set up the vocabulary for activities.\n\nAbout activity-specific boards\nFor many years, activity-specific boards for communication have been developed and used with AAC users.\n\nActivity board for Mealtime- made in Proloquo2Go\nActivity board for mealtimes\nAn activity-specific board contains the specific words that may be needed for a particular activity. They are often printed out as a light-tech board. They might be used in place of a full AAC system. They include quick phrases, as well as single words. Teams may spend many hours creating folders of different activities.\n\nMany AAC tools include some example activity boards. Proloquo2Go includes a few examples within the Crescendo Vocabulary. PODD - both digital and print variations within the simPODD app - contain some activity boards.\n\nUsing some activity communication boards can be appropriate in some activities. But it should not replace use of the full AAC system.\n\nAnd here is why.\n\n5 Limitations of activity boards.\nThere are 5 main limitations of using activity boards with AAC users.\n\nActivity board for bowling\nActivity board for bowling\n1. Limit language opportunities.\nFirstly, we can only talk about those things included on the activity board. At bowling, we can use this board to talk about the game. However, how can we speak about other topics? Will we only talk about bowling during our bowling trip?\n\nActivity boards may limit language opportunities.\n\nActivity Board for Horse Riding\nActivity board for horse riding\n2. Limit learning of words in the AAC system\nNext, often activity boards are printed as paper boards. They are brought out during the activity and then put away again. AAC users may learn how to say things on the board. But they are not learning where they can find these words in their AAC system. An AAC user may learn the word “horse” on their horse riding board, but they cannot find “horse” in their communication device to talk about their cousin’s horse.\n\nActivity boards may limit learning of words in the AAC system.\n\n3. May not support core word learning and motor planning\nActivity boards, may or may not have included some core words. If core words were used, they may not have been placed on the boards, in consistent locations, from one board to the next. Different locations of words on boards can make it harder to develop a strong motor plan, to find words quickly and easily.\n\nActivity boards may not support core word learning and motor planning.\n\nActivity-specific board for Bubbles\nActivity board for Bubbles\n4. Stops language generalizing from one situation to another\nActivity boards give a person very specific words to use in a specific situation. Therefore, they may not get the chance to see those words used in different places, for different activities. How can they learn about the power and flexibility of language? For example, perhaps an AAC user has learnt to point to “blow” and “pop” on an activity-board for “bubbles”. What if they need to learn to use the word “blow” when they want to blow out the candles on the cake? Or they need to use the word “pop” to describe the sound the balloon made?\n\nActivity boards may stop language generalizing from one situation to another.\n\n5. Time consuming\nTeams can spend time making activity boards. Making one board for every activity that will be done, can take time.\n\nMaking activity boards is time consuming.\n\n\n\nUsing your balanced vocabulary\nAn AAC system has a balanced vocabulary when you can communicate for a wide variety of reasons using core words, fringe vocabulary and the alphabet.\n\nConsider how we can use this vocabulary, rather than just activity boards.\n\nWe can focus on teaching and modeling words in the AAC system, during any activity! We show where words can be found and how to combine them to communicate real messages in any situation. We can focus on communicating different messages for different reasons.\n\nWe do this, rather than creating specific folders or boards for all the different activities we might do.\n\nBy using a balanced vocabulary, AAC users have far more words at their fingertips! More words gives them more opportunities to build language.\n\nBy using a balanced vocabulary, AAC users can learn where words are, so they can use them later. Try adding extra words to existing folders rather than creating an activity folder.\n\nActivity boards - the right way!\nThere are times and places where activity boards can be very useful. There are many AAC users who may get their first start at communication using an activity board. This may be before they have their own AAC system.\n\nWhen you decide to make an activity board, you may wish to consider a few of these ideas:\n\nUse a template, so that common core words can be in the same locations on any different activity boards you create.\nIf you are using Proloquo2Go, you can use the folder templates and activity templates to create boards.\nHave a full core word board, alongside an activity board - just in case you need extra words!\nBe ready with the full AAC system, to model other words during the activity.\nHave a way for the AAC user to ask for their full AAC tool.\nIf you are using a printed or digital PODD, remember to flip back from the Activity page. Go back to the start when you want to begin a message for a different reason.\nDownload Proloquo2Go Crescendo Core word boards from the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom.\n\nActivity-specific board for swimming\nActivity board for swimming, created using a Proloquo2Go Crescendo template.\nUseful times to use activity boards:\nHere are some example situations when activity boards might be useful.\n\nWhen AAC learners start, a few activity boards for favorite activities can really kick start communication. Make sure activity boards are used alongside an AAC system. They should not be the only tool.\nA printed paper activity board may be useful in situations where having a device is not ideal. For example: outdoor activities like the beach or the pool, or during messy activities like art or cooking.\nActivity boards are useful when communicators are going into new situations. We want them to say their messages quickly and easily. This applies where they will be talking to unfamiliar people. For example, community outings, ordering food at a cafe, buying a train ticket, giving a speech at a meeting, etc.\nBoards are ideal when AAC is not available.\nStart using balanced vocabulary\nUsing your balanced vocabulary to build language is powerful for AAC users. Use activity boards in specific situations but not for everything.'),(18,'Roadblock: Give up too soon\nA consistent roadblock with Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is people giving up too soon. Do not give up too soon! Be persistent. Make a plan for success. Celebrate successes.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) takes time. AAC learners need many opportunities to see their AAC system being used to communicate real messages in everyday situations before they can use their system consistently and effectively.\n\nWhen teams give up too soon\nIn practice, we often see the teams supporting AAC users give up too soon. They try the AAC system for a few weeks. Maybe they set up some folders or buttons. Perhaps they do modeling during snack and circle time. They try prompting the AAC user to give the “correct” answers. When the AAC user does not respond in the way they expect or wish, they assume the AAC user is not ready. They might also assume that the selected AAC system is the wrong one.\n\nOften they give up using the AAC system. If the AAC system is continued to be used, it is often simplified. A simple AAC system makes it impossible to communicate anything novel or interesting. None of this helps an AAC user achieve successful communication.\n\nSome think AAC systems are highly intuitive and the AAC user should just know how to use it. AAC learners cannot do this without any practice or instruction.\n\nWe need to realize that learning an AAC system, or any language system, takes practice and time. Jane Korsten, OTR, reminds us that:\n\n“It is critical for an individual to not only have symbols, but also to have experience with those symbols in a symbol rich environment / print rich environment. The typically developing child will have been exposed to oral language for approximately 4,380 waking hours by the time he begins speaking at about 18 months of age.\n\nIf someone is using a different symbol set and only has exposure to it two times a week, for 20 – 30 minutes each, it will take the alternate symbol user 84 years to have the same experience with his symbols that the typically developing child has with the spoken word in 18 months!!!” -Jane Korsten, OTR, QIAT ListServe, 4/4/2011\nBe persistent\nThe truth is, that for AAC to work, we need to be persistent. We need to try and try again. We need to give AAC time, real time to be established. We start with a balanced AAC system, and then we need to:\n\nModel regularly and reliably. Start modeling. Then model more.\nWork with Communication partners so everyone is prompting and responding to the AAC user appropriately.\nMake sure the AAC user is engaged and motivated to communicate.\nPut many activities in place that will support and build language and continue the momentum toward successful AAC.\nPersistent and consistent use of good AAC strategies are essential for success. AAC takes time.\n\nMake a plan for success\nLook at the tools and strategies you want to put in place to achieve successful AAC. Set goals for the team as to how these strategies will be used. Set timelines to achieve these goals. Our chances of success are greater when the team is on board with goals and direction.\n\nCelebrate small successes\nWhen an AAC user makes a positive step with communication, we can build on this success. First celebrate the success! Take photos and videos of success stories to share with other members of the team. Next, look at what worked, what happened and who did what… and do that again!\n\nAlso, don’t give up when things go wrong. When things are challenging, or feel like they are not working, it is important to keep trying. You can review situations and identify difficulties and barriers. Problem solve these with the team.\n\nOvercome the Roadblock\nDon’t give up on AAC! Give AAC time! There is so much to be achieved when we give a voice to AAC users!\n\nTake the test: Check the Learn AAC Guide to see where you are in establishing AAC for an AAC user. This may help you overcome any roadblocks stopping you from success!'),(19,'Roadblock: Lack of support in different environments\nA common roadblock results when Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is not supported in different environments. Make AAC available in those different environments. Support it by working with teams. Collect evidence to share.\n\nCommunication happens all day long. We talk at home, at school, at work, out and about and in the community. How does this look for someone using Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)? Do they have a way to communicate in all situations?\n\nSadly, the reality is that often an AAC user does not have the necessary supports in place to be able to use their AAC system in different environments.\n\nMake AAC always available\nAAC needs to be available across different environments. Maybe we need cases and straps so that the AAC system can be more portable. Then AAC can be taken to the different places the AAC user goes. Perhaps we need to create a light-tech/paper-based AAC options to be used across environments.\n\nIn addition, we should plan for when AAC is not available. This includes planning for how communication might look in medical settings.\n\nA way to ask\nIn some situations, an AAC user does not have their communication device. Do they have a way to ask for it?\n\nSome strategies that can give a person a way to ask for their AAC, include:\n\nWrist bands or symbol cards to indicate that they need their AAC.\n“Calling out” or vocalizing to get the attention of their communication partner.\nA single-message button recorded to say “Please get my AAC system”.\nA laminated information page that the person carries to share how they communicate, and asking someone to get their AAC system.\nWorking with teams\nGetting all the team members on board can lead to more positive outcomes. Teams need support and training in AAC and how to work with the AAC user. Hands on practice of skills such as modeling and communication partner skills will help teams to support an AAC user better.\n\nPractical time to plan and prepare for AAC in everyday activities will also help. Encourage and support all team members to ask questions and ask for help.\n\nWith people on board, AAC can be better supported across different environments.\n\nCollect videos\nTake videos and photos of AAC users using their system in different environments. These videos can be shown to other team members to highlight strategies that work, and even examples of things that have not worked. They are also a great way of tracking progress. Videos are a solid teaching tool - they provide real examples of AAC in action.\n\nOvercome the Roadblock\nGet AAC happening everywhere! Make AAC available and support teams to use it! There is so much to be achieved when we give a voice to AAC users!\n\nWith the help of the Learn AAC Guide you can see where you are in establishing AAC for an AAC user. This may help you overcome any roadblocks stopping you from success!'),(20,'Roadblock: Stalled at choice-making and requesting\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is easily stalled when requesting is the focus. Do not limit language by only offering choices. Instead, model language for different communication functions.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) use can sometimes be limited. AAC users learn to communicate for one common reason. They learn to make requests. AAC users can get really good at asking for things. They can make requests for food, favorite shows, places to go, YouTube videos, etc. This is an important and motivating reason to communicate. And it may be one of the first reasons an AAC user uses their communication device.\n\nBut everyday we communicate for a wide variety of reasons. We call these reasons, communication functions. We can say what we think, ask for things, tell stories and jokes, ask questions, and share what we know and more.\n\nOften AAC users get stuck or stalled at choice-making and requesting.\n\nImpact of being stalled\nThree key issues come up when someone is stuck at requesting.\n\n1. Limited conversations\nRequesting does not play a big role in most day to day conversations. If all the AAC user can do is ask for things, it is likely to be hard to chat with them. How long would you want to talk to someone who only asked you for things? AAC users can be supported to combine words to say more. With more words and language, AAC users can join in conversations and interactions.\n\n2. Used as a teaching strategy\nIn some situations, requesting has been used as a strict teaching protocol. Items are withheld until the AAC user asks for them. Sometimes an AAC user is required to ask for the same things frequently. Often the item is removed, just so they have to ask for it again!\n\nThese teaching strategies can be stressful for an AAC user. They can make an AAC user dislike their communication tools and distrust their support team. These impact on learning communication in natural social interactions.\n\n3. Low expectations\nSome AAC users are only given the chance to make requests with their communication device. Often teams encourage and support this. And AAC users get stuck there. Support teams lower their expectations. They start thinking that making choices is the only thing the AAC user can do. They do not provide the opportunities and teaching to learn to communicate for more reasons.\n\nPlan and consider communication functions\nConsider communication functions as soon as you start using AAC. We can move on from requesting when we teach AAC users to use language to communicate for a variety of reasons. Use this to plan goals and activities. Use it to guide what words may need to be taught and modeled. We can see what words are needed beyond those for choice-making. These words can open up a world of language for an AAC user!\n\nFor a full list of communication functions to consider for an AAC user, find the Communication Functions in the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom.\n\nOvercome the Roadblock\nDon’t get stuck in requesting! Move on and give language to AAC users! There is so much to be achieved when we give a voice to AAC users!\n\nWith the help of the Learn AAC Guide, you can see where you are in establishing AAC for an AAC user. This may help you overcome any roadblocks stopping you from success!'),(21,'Get practical ideas for building language\nWe need to have bank of ideas and materials that support continued modeling and AAC learning. These ideas build language and communication.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a journey. Each and every day we can move forward. Together we build language and meaningful communication.\n\nAAC users learn when they are given many opportunities to see and hear language on their AAC.\n\nThis article provides a wide bank of ideas that can be used to build language and communication. Many of these ideas may spark interest. Jazz up your speech therapy with these ideas. Make home fun and rich in language. Keep teams inspired to support the AAC user in new and different ways.\n\nFor these ideas to work, we should:\n\nMake AAC always available,\nGet the team on board,\nRemember to model, and\nEngage and interact with the AAC user.\nAll of these ideas can been seen as opportunities to:\n\nTeach core words,\nModel grammar and\nIntegrate literacy instruction.\nIllustration of lady playing with blocks\nAlways choose activities, games and books that are in line with what other people their age would do and enjoy.\nRemember to show respect for the age of AAC users. Always choose activities, games and books that are in line with what other people their age would do and enjoy.\n\nShared reading symbol\nUsing books to build language\nBooks can be fun and interactive. We can read the words, or tell stories from the pictures. Shared reading experiences can be a fabulous way to build language. We should talk about what we are seeing in the book, not only read the words. Books also provide an ideal opportunity to find and model core words. Add fringe vocabulary and some alphabet work to this, for even more language and learning.\n\nCore words when sharing books:\nWe can model many core words when reading books.\n\nFor example, core words such as: look, what?, where?, think, do, more, different, good, bad, etc.\n\nWe can also look at the words, pictures and concepts in the book and think about what additional words could be modeled.\n\n\nFor example, if we are reading the funny book: “Piranhas don’t eat bananas” by Aaron Babley, there are many things we can model.\n\nCore words: eat, not eat, bad, that bad, we eat, what eat, like, not like, want eat, eat different, think good, think bad, etc.\nThen add fringe words from the foods, fruits and body parts folders.\nWe might not have the word “piranha” in the AAC system, so this is a good chance to model spelling a new word on the keyboard.\nMore book ideas\nHere is a list of additional ideas for using books to build language, with a little literacy on the side!\n\nRetell stories: Retell stories using pictures from the book. Use alternative pencils to re-write parts or all of the story.\nStory Props: Use story props (large pictures, puppets or real objects) to retell the story.\nSequencing: Make cards of the major events in the story. Put cards into the correct order and retell story.\nText innovation: Retell the story but change details such as characters, settings.\nDifferent ending: Tell the story again but give it a different ending.\nLift the flaps: Read books with flaps to lift. If the book doesn’t have any, make your own with post-it-notes.\nGet in the book: Retell the story, but put yourself in the story. Stick your photo over pictures in the book.\nCartoon and speech bubbles: Turn the book into a cartoon. Draw speech bubbles on post-it notes and think of what characters can say.\nShare the book: Visit a friend, family member or another class room to share the book. You can also design and write a flyer/invitation to tell friends or others about your book reading session.\nMake silly mistakes: Make silly mistakes when reading the book. Discuss. Then write sentences with mistakes. You can also practice editing skills when correcting the mistakes.\nRhyming words: Find words that rhyme in the book. Say them and try to think of more words that rhyme. Write lists of rhyming word families found in the book.\nFirst sounds/letters: Focus on finding words that start with a particular sound/letter in the book. Write lists of words that start with a particular sound.\nOpinions: Discuss what you thought of the book. Write a book review of the book. Give it a star rating.\nFavorite page: Find your favorite page in the book. Why do you like it? Rewrite the text for your favorite page.\nSyllable beats: Find long and short words in the book and clap and count the beats (syllables) in each word. Try spelling long words, syllable by syllable.\nCharacter feelings: Discuss how characters are feeling during different parts of the story.\nCharacter descriptions: Describe different characters in the book. Write descriptions of characters. Can you read the descriptions and match to the characters?\nWord kinds: Hunt for different kinds of words in the book, e.g. verbs, vs nouns, vs adjectives. Write lists of different kinds of words from the book.\nSynonyms: Find words in the book, and think of synonyms for those words. How many different words can you think of, that mean the same thing? Rewrite the sentence using synonyms. Write a list of synonyms.\nAntonyms: Find words in the book, and think of antonyms for those words. How many different words can you think of, that mean the opposite thing? Rewrite the sentence using antonym. Write a list of synonym and antonym (opposites) pairs.\nMake your own books: Use photos and videos to make your own books. Print these books and add them to the shelf so they can be read often.\nAlso think about how we can use different printed book materials for activities:\n\nJunk Mail/catalogues: Read junk mail/catalogues. Write a wish list or gift list or shopping list.\nMagazines: Read different magazines. Write a list of places to visit, people you’d like to meet, things you want to see/buy.\nTravel Brochures: Share travel brochures and find amazing places to go and things to see. Write lists of places to travel to and activities to try.\nCook books: Read different cook books. Write ingredient lists. Write procedural text to explain how to make something.\nNonfiction books: Read nonfiction books on different topics. Research topics of interest. Brainstorm a word web of things you learnt about the topic.\nInstruction manuals: Look at manuals to figure out how things work. Re-write instructions so they are easier. Take photos of favorite mechanical objects or appliances and write your own instructional manual to explain how it works.\nNewspapers: Read about news, weather and sport in newspapers. Write daily weather reports. Write lists of best sporting teams and games being played. Find and discuss good news stories. Find ways to share and discuss the not-so-good news.\nElectronic books: Make use of awesome websites such as Tar Heel Reader, for more books in a different format. Convert your Tar Heel Reader books into Pictello, where they can be read aloud, edited and shared even more easily.\nFor some example Core Word Planners around books, visit the Literacy and Language section of the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom.\n\ntoys - symbol\nUsing toys/games to build language\nPeople of all ages like to play! We all have favorite toys and games. Find toys and games that are engaging. Do activities that create opportunities to model language during play.\n\nRepeated play gives us the chance to model language regularly. We should also try new things during each interaction in play. For example, bubbles may be a favorite activity. Mix up the activity. Try different bubble blowers and wands. Go to different places to blow bubbles. Catch the bubbles with different things (e.g. not just hands, but fly swats, gloves, etc.). Be creative so that new concepts can be modeled within the activities. Dr Caroline Musselwhite would call it “repetition with variety”.\n\nRemember to show respect for the age of AAC users. Always choose toys and games that are in-line with what other people their age would do and enjoy.\n\nCore words in play:\nWe can model many core words when playing. For example, core words such as: more, finished, want, like, different, play, do, go, on, off, in, mine, me, you, yours, etc.\n\nWe can also look closely at the toy or game and think about what additional words could be modeled.\n\n\nFor example, if we are playing Mr Potato Head, there are many things we can model.\n\nCore words: put, on, off, more, get, what, who, where, good, bad, like, where, etc.\nThen add fringe words of body parts, clothing and colors.\nWhen Mr Potato Head dresses up as a “mermaid”, we might not have that word in the AAC system, so this is a good chance to model spelling a new word on the keyboard.\nMore toys & games ideas\nThe list of toys and games is endless. Do you have favorite games and toys you use with your AAC users? Here is a quick list of some toys and games that could be used to build language.\n\nBuilding and construction toys: lego, duplo, wooden blocks, hammer, screws, nails\nBall toys: soft balls, bouncy balls, basketball, soccer, tennis, balloons\nHome corner play: kitchen, baby dolls, bedtime, shopping, tea parties\nCars and vehicle play: cars, trucks, planes, ramps, roads, mail tubes as tunnels\nOutdoor play: hide-and-seek, obstacle courses, skipping, hula hoops, swings, slides, scooter boards\nTabletop games: puzzles, play dough, kinetic sand, threading\nBoardgames: Jenga, Twister, Guess who, Snakes and Ladders, Pie face, Bingo. More games we can play.\nFavorites: bubbles, Mr Potato head\nSensory toys: swinging, hammocks, bean bags, body socks, fidget toys, squishy and squeezy toys, lights, light tubes, lava lamps.\nThere are many awesome play-based apps, that can be played on tablets. Fun and interactive, they can be a great way to engage and model language. To find the best play apps, check out these app developers:\n\nToca Boca\nTinybop\nLego\nSago Mini\nDr Panda\nBamba\nMy PlayHome\nThere are many more! Do you have favorite play-based apps?\n\nAny play activity can incorporate literacy, with a bit of creativity. Try some of these ideas:\n\nMake your own books: Use photos and videos for toys, games and during play to make your own books. Print these books and add them to the shelf so they can be read often.\nLists: Write lists of favorite toys and games. Use the list to vote for what game to play next. Write a wish list of toys or games from a store catalogue. Write a list of the things you could make, (e.g. make a tower, castle, fence, etc.)\nFirst sounds/letters: While playing, try finding words that start with a particular sound/letter in the game. Write lists of words that start with a particular sound.\nRhyming words: While playing, try finding words that rhyme in the game. Say them and try to think of more words that rhyme. Write lists of rhyming word families found in the game.\nFor some example Core Word Planners around toys and games, visit the Leisure Time section of the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom. Also, the Core Word 5 Minute Fillers have some quick and fun activity ideas, with some great starting points for modeling.\n\nMusic - symbol\nUsing music to build language\nMusic is a powerful way to engage AAC users. Music is motivating. It\'s use of rhythm and repetition allow opportunities to build language.\n\nCore words in music:\nWe can model many core words when doing music activities. For example, core words such as: more, finished, want, like, different, play, on, off, up, down, good, bad, etc.\n\nWe can also look closely at the music activity and think about what additional words could be modeled.\n\n\nFor example, if we are choosing a “Song of the day”, there are many things we can model.\n\nCore words: what, like, think, good, bad, up, down, on, off, who, etc.\nThen add fringe words from the music & sound adjectives/describing words folders.\nWhen choosing a new song like \"Gangham style\", we might not have that word in the AAC system. This is a good chance to model spelling a new word on the keyboard.\nMore music ideas\nHere are a few more ideas to use music to build language.\n\nChoosing music: Make choices about songs or artists to listen to, or to sing along to. Choose musical instruments.\nSong of the day: Every day one song is chosen, and it can be played throughout the day. Every one can take a turn to pick a song. And everyone gets to give their opinion of chosen songs. Make sure you make song selections from various genres: opera, country, not just modern music. Also choose catchy, yet annoying songs every now and then (e.g. Macarena, Gangham Style, The Nutbush, Achy Break Heart, etc.)\nSong innovations: Change the words to familiar songs to mix things up. For example, Baa Baa Black Sheep - could be changed to “Baa Baa Green Sheep”. There are lots of fun online websites that can allow you to change song lyrics to popular songs - in the style of Mad libs!\nLyric writers: Write your own song from scratch, based on ideas and areas of interest. Songs can be lists, favorite words, or poems. Try the website Melobytes to change these words into music!\nRaps: Write words, lists or poems and turn them into to raps! The app AutoRap will change any words (even those spoken by an AAC device) into a rap.\nPuppet concerts: Pick your favorite song and some puppet characters and make a concert. For example, perhaps the monkey puppet sings “Katy Perry” on the beach. You can create high-tech concerts by using the app Puppet Pals.\nParty music: Plan the music you want to play for a party. Write lists. Vote for songs.\nArtist of the week: Choose an artist and listen to different songs from them for the week. Share thoughts and opinions about the artist, the songs and their style of music.\nThe Voice: Hold auditions for “The Voice”, just like the TV show. Have judges on spinning chairs. Give opinions about performance and let people know if they are in or out!\nMake your own musical instruments: Make DIY musical instruments out of boxes and containers.\nYou can find a general Core Word Planner for music in the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom.\n\n\nBuild language in conversations\nConversations can be referred to as those talks between two or more people. News, ideas, and feelings are shared in conversations. These chats happen everyday. They are often fast moving about a variety of topics. Sometimes we talk about about the activity in front of us. But more likely, speakers will chat more about their life, their interests and their plans. AAC users are often not given the chance to participate in conversations.\n\nHow can we give AAC learners opportunities to engage with the people around them? They need chances to see and hear conversations. We can model in conversations. This will help them to learn how they can find the right words to take up their turn in a conversation. Modeling telling news, asking questions, changing topics will all help an AAC user.\n\nDoes an AAC user have a balanced AAC system that gives them the words and language needed to join a conversation? It can be difficult to predict exactly what words we might need. We could talk about anything! This is why we need so many words! Core and fringe words can be combined in many different ways to say many different things. And conversations can be a great way to model typing new words that we need into our keyboard, if we cannot find them in our AAC system.\n\nWe can often find incidental opportunities to start conversations within an activity we do. For example, while you are doing a farm puzzle, the AAC user may remember the story about a time they went to a farm. Use this side conversation to model about the farm trip (e.g. We went to a farm, Farm was fun, I liked the chickens, We fed the pigs, etc.). If a different or related topic of conversation comes up, go with it and see what extra words and interaction happens.\n\nLastly, one of the most important things we can do for an AAC user in conversations is to allow time. Pause and wait during conversations to give them the time they need to offer something into the conversation. Without pause and wait time, conversations can move on quickly without the AAC user having a chance to say anything.\n\nMore conversation ideas\nHere are some example areas of conversations that we can work on:\n\nTell news: Model and talk about things that have happened. Use photos of past events. Save news and stories onto the AAC system to be used quickly and easily.\nAsk questions: Show how you can ask questions during conversations. Remember that open-ended questions will allow more language practice, and let the AAC user take more control of the conversation.\nStart a conversation: Teach how you can start a conversation by telling news or asking questions. Save good conversation starters onto the AAC system to be used quickly and easily.\nChanging topic: It is very useful to be able to change the topic of conversation. Model what words you can use to change the topic. You may save quick phrases onto an AAC user’s system.\nKeep a conversation going: There are many social interjections we use during conversations to keep the conversation going. They can be statements like: Wow!; Really?; What!; That’s great!; No way! Whatever!, etc. Model how these can be used when you are chatting. If you are using Proloquo2Go, you can find these kinds of words in the Chat > Expressions folder.\nTell jokes: Telling jokes can be a great way to break the ice and start some fun social interaction. Save favorite jokes into the AAC system to be used at any time.\nGive compliments: Giving someone a compliment can be a great way to start a conversation. Give compliments to the AAC user. Model the words you need to say nice things to the people around you.\nGive your opinion: Say what you think! When someone shares news or ideas, the people around them will often say what they think. Give AAC user a chance to give positive or negative comments to show what they think.\n\n\nBuild language in everyday routines\nDay in and day out, we stick to some common routines. How can we build AAC into these? Use every chance we have to model words and sentences on AAC.\n\nIf things might get wet (eg. in the bath/shower), think about using light-tech or paper-based versions of your AAC system.\n\nCore words in everyday routines:\nWe can model many core words when doing common routines. For example, core words such as: more, finished, do, put, take, give, go, different, on, off, here, there, good, bad, etc.\n\nWe can also look closely at the routine activity and think about what additional words could be modeled.\n\n\nFor example, if we are folding and putting away the washing, there are many things we can model.\n\nCore words: help, do, put, give, take, go, here, there, in, out, like, think, good, bad, where, who, now, etc.\nThen add fringe words of clothing, people and where words.\nWhen we are folding the washing, we might find a new t-shirt with a slogan on the front. We might not have those words in the AAC system, so this is a good chance to model spelling a new word on the keyboard.\nMore everyday ideas:\nLook at your everyday routines and find ways to model more and build language. Here are some examples:\n\nCooking: Talk about what you have to do, the ingredients, the taste, what you like or dislike about it, etc.\nWatching TV & movies: Talk about what happened. Who’s your favorite character? Which part do you like most? How did it made you feel (eg. scared/excited)?\nLooking at photos: Talk about the pictures, the people, what happened, what you like, what you see, etc.\nTidying up: Talk about what you have to do. Folding and putting laundry away. Discuss where socks and other clothing goes. Put away the groceries and talk about what goes in the fridge and what in the cupboard.\nMassage: During regular massage session, model language. Talk about body parts.\nEveryday routines: Talk about what you are doing during everyday routines like brushing hair, bath time, getting dressed, bedtime, etc.\nGoing out: Plan what you need to take when you go out. Talk about where and when you are going and who you might see.\nThere are many ways to create language opportunities at home.\n\nGo to the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom for many more ideas and planners around common routines that will help you to teach core words and build language.\n\n\nUsing creativity and exploration to build language\nGet creative with AAC users of any age! Making and creating and exploring can be engaging ways to build lots of language.\n\nIf things might get messy, think about using light-tech or paper-based versions of your AAC system.\n\nCore words in Creative activities:\nWe can model many core words when doing creative activities. For example, core words such as: more, finished, want, make, put, help, there, here, all, some, different good, bad, etc.\n\nWe can also look closely at the creative activity and think about what additional words could be modeled.\n\n\nFor example, if we are doing card-making, there are many things we can model.\n\nCore words: who, give, put on, like that, want more, different, for you, etc.\nThen add fringe words of colors, shapes, art supplies and chat words.\nWhen making the cards, we need write who we want to send the card to. We might not have that person’s name in the AAC system, so this is a good chance to model spelling names on the keyboard.\nMore creative ideas\nLet’s look at a few more ideas on how to get creative and build language:\n\nCard making: Make cards for friends and families. Discuss designs and colors. Cards can be for birthdays, thank you cards, Christmas and Get Well cards. Write lists of names to send cards to. Plan and write special messages and greetings to put inside each card.\nScrapbooking: Use photos and paper and paint to make scrapbooks. Write stories about each photo. Decorate a little or a lot.\nPainting: There are so many ways to get creative with painting. From the materials, to the tools, there are many choices and options. Create painting inspired by other artists. Explore adding different textures and using different tools to paint. Take photos of finished paintings and use them to make your own books. Print these books and add them to the shelf so they can be read often.\nCostume Design: Plan costume parties and design special outfits.

Sure, it is great when a learner grabs your arm to lead you to the snack cupboard or hands you a juice box to get help opening it. Those are important communicative acts that we celebrate. But moving beyond pre-symbolic forms of communication to using signs and pictures, allows us to expand their vocabularies outside of the ‘here and now’ and enables them to communicate effectively with less familiar partners. When we’ve crossed the bridge into symbolic communication, we’re building a foundation for language development. If things go well, the learner will steadily acquire new symbols and words, eventually allowing us to work on word combinations.\n\nAre you working with AAC learners who at the early sentence level? If so, you may be considering how to build the length and complexity of their utterances. In some ways, this is no different than the strategies you would use with speaking children at this level. Here are some things to think about as you proceed.\n\n1. Add-A-Word: Respond to any communicative attempt by adding a single word to whatever the communicator says (E.g., “More” becomes “Want more;” “Want more” becomes “Want more milk;” “Want more milk” becomes “I want more milk”).\n2. Focus on a specific target: Maximize your therapy effectiveness by knowing exactly HOW you want the AAC learner to increase sentence length. Are you going for more verbs? Adding descriptors? Using pronouns? Which ones? Get specific so that you can teach that particular word, model sentences with that kind of word, and provide many practice opportunities on that specific word type.\n3. Tempt a longer utterance and scaffold: A learner who is used to 2-word sentences (e.g., “want cracker”) will probably need help building up the length. One way to do that is to have options that relate to the initial request, such as a big piece of cracker and a little piece of cracker if I am trying to expand the sentence with a descriptor.\n\n“Want cracker”\n“Big or little””\n“Big”\n“Want big cracker”\n4. Respond contingently: As soon as the learner produces the target utterance, respond to the intent (not the form).\n\n“Want more milk” should result in getting more milk, not a comment on ‘good talking’ or ‘saying the whole thing.’\n“Want go to the store” should result on an acknowledgement even if you can’t comply with the request (e.g., “Tomorrow. We can go to the store tomorrow.”)\n5. Model the longer utterance with aided language input: Always a critical strategy for beginning communicators, this is something we highly recommend until the learner is familiar with his/her AAC system and uses it fluently.\n6. Repeat in various contexts: Learners gain skills more quickly when we provide a lot of instruction with different materials and in various activities.\n7. Consider changing the communicative function: Don’t restrict the learner to using longer utterances for just one purpose. Beginning with requests may be a good idea for some learners, but once they get the hang of it broaden out to using longer sentences for protesting (e.g., “No more” becomes “No more milk”) or commenting (e.g., “See car” becomes “See red car”).\n8. Individualize: Many beginning communicators are motivated by requests for things they want or activities they want to do. That wasn’t the case for Jonah, however. This little guy was much more motivated by social interaction, attention, and connecting with other people just for the joy of it. It’s not always about ‘the stuff.’ For Jonah, some initial targets could be:\n\n“Go” to “Go see;” Then “Go see Carly” or “Me go see”\n“Play” to “Play now;” Then “Me play now” or “Carly play now”\n9. Spread the news: Share the specific goal that the learner is working on so that others can facilitate the process and take note of attempts to use the longer sentence. We build generalization through planning and teamwork, not just doing our intervention and ‘hoping’ the skill generalizes.\n\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts on helping beginning communicators build longer sentences.\n'),(23,'A PrAACtical Literacy Activity for Beginning Communicators\nWe’ve been having a great time supporting beginning communicators and gently modeling how they can be involved in literacy learning activities. In this post, we share a super simple activity to build alphabet knowledge and letter-sound correspondence. It has worked well (or fairly well) for beginning communicators who:\n\nAre just learning to establish cause-effect relationships\nHave little interest in existing classroom alphabet activities\nAre verbal, but reluctantly\nAre reluctant participants in group activities and seem to prefer being alone\nHave no formal AAC system, but would benefit from one\nTreat books and other printed materials as objects to spin, rip, or throw\nHave not been given the opportunity to participate in traditional literacy instruction.\nWe love it because:\n\nIt is is quick and easy.\nIt requires almost no advance planning other than having a camera (or one on your phone/mobile device)\nOther people in the classroom notice us doing real literacy work with kids they may not have thought capable of learning alphabet skills\nWe can repeat it with different items or letters to build familiarity with the activity and skills\nIt’s easy to do.

You’re all ready to go!\n\nBut… life is never that simple.\n\nYou meet your newest student who has a whole different set of picture symbols – Symbolstix – on his device.\n\nHow is that even possible? Why are there different symbols? You spent so much time, energy, and money putting those PCS symbols all over the place last year. Do you take it all down and start from scratch? Do you add all of the symbols to everything so you’re prepared? Do you hide in the corner and cry??\n\nOkay, don’t resort to crying just yet! Let’s think about this.\n\nWhat is the goal?\n\nThink back to the very basics of AAC. What is the goal?\n\nAt the end of the day, we hope that users of AAC are effective and efficient communicators. In order to achieve that, we want people to be able to say what they want, when they want it. This is also known as SNUG – Spontaneous Novel Utterance Generation (Hill). This is typically achieved by using some combination of alpha/numeric typing and communication symbols, as a symbolic communication system cannot be preprogrammed to contain every fringe word in the universe. Therefore, it is vital that we are teaching how to use both alpha/numeric AND communication symbols.\n\nWhat does this mean for schools?\n\nSchools are intuitively designed for consistent exposure to literacy skills, including letters and numbers. However, we have to think critically to design classroom environments for symbolic communication exposure as well. We also know that, in order to speak AAC, we must teach AAC. If we expect someone to use AAC, we have to use AAC. That’s the foundation for aided language input and modeling (Binger & Light, 2007; Drager et. al., 2006, 2010; Goossens’, Crain, & Elder, 1992; Harris & Reichle, 2004).\n\nWhat does this look like?\n\nBe thoughtful of how to spend your time\n\nNo matter how shiny your superhero cape is, you are limited to 24 hours in a day. Spend that time thoughtfully!\n\nIt likely isn’t worth your time to take each of your favorite books, identify targeted core vocabulary, finding the symbols on the computer, printing the symbols in the appropriate size, cutting the symbols out, and gluing them into the book. This might be okay to do once a month, with the help of support staff, if all of your students are using the same symbols. However, once multiple symbol sets get involved, this becomes too complicated and time-consuming.\n\n(For more information on when you should and shouldn’t add symbols to books, check out this presentation from AAC in the Cloud in 2017).\n\nSometimes it’s easy to get lost in projects and forget what the end goal is – consistent and easy exposure to symbolic language for modeling purposes.\n\nCore Word Wall – Making it easy to model for everyone\n\nIt’s not easy to add a symbol for each symbol set in every nook and cranny of a classroom. However, it is possible to do a bit of upfront work to make modeling for everyone a bit easier!image depicts sets of core vocabulary words printed in different symbol sets, grouped by core word\n\n \n\nTry printing out 1 copy of your core board with both (or all) of the symbol sets used by the students in your classroom. As you can see in the picture above, I placed the SymbolStix symbol on the left, and the PCS symbol on the right, for motor planning purposes. You can use editing software (such as SymbolStix PRIME, Chat Editor {Free}, Communicator 5, Boardmaker Online, etc.) to capture images of the symbols, with or without background color. Then, you can use one of many software like PowerPoint, Word, or even Google Docs to place the symbols side-by-side and print them. Once laminated, these symbols can be used to model using 2 symbol sets at one time!\n\nFor more information on classroom core boards, please see the following resources:\n\nCarla Butorac from Behavior Communicates\nAAC in the High School Classroom: Where Core Vocabulary Meets Life Skills\nJenna Rayburn Kirk from Speech Room News\nBring it with you\n\nimage depicts binder with file folders holding core vocabulary symbols\n\nA teacher I worked with years ago came up with an idea to bring a students’ core vocabulary symbols with her everywhere around the school. We took a binder and filled it with file folders, which are nice and sturdy. From there, we lined the file folders with Velcro strips and used them to store low-tech core vocabulary symbols. This became a mobile modeling tool, as well as a backup in case her high-tech system failed! It’s also cheap to make and efficient to use. Win-win!\n\nModel on the student’s device\n\nStudents need to see us using their devices too. If you’re not invested in using it, why should they be?image depicts student’s device which reads “outside it’s time for Mickey Mouse later later later\n\n \n\nWhile this isn’t a preferred method for every student (there have been several students who are protective of their devices), this often shows the student how they can use their device in the moment, often for powerful and motivating consequences (like watching Mickey Mouse!).\n\nTalk it out\n\nOne of the reasons core vocabulary symbols are so difficult to learn is because they are very challenging to depict. Because of that, symbol sets can have different images to symbolize the same words. Rather than ignore these differences, why not talk through them?\n\nTry carving out 5 minutes each day during Morning Meeting to talk about the Core Word of the Week.\n\nI Spy Core – Find the core symbol hidden around the classroom\nRead a book with the core word\nSing a song with the core word\nTalk about it – How do both of the symbols represent the core word?

You’ll get a lot of bang for your buck with core symbols. Set them up in your classroom wisely.\n'),(25,'Eva doesn’t seem to be interested in any of the books or playthings her SLP typically uses, and reinforcer preference testing was inconclusive.\n\nZach tends to grab the teacher’s materials and put them in his mouth, or sometimes bang them on a hard surface.\n\nBryce often engages with them for a few seconds then drops or throws them.\n\nDo you work with students like these? They have lots of AAC learning ahead of them, but creating therapy sessions or instructional lessons is a challenge because of the ways in which they interact with the materials. For some students, keeping the number of materials to a minimum can be helpful. Here are a few things to try.  \n\nCreate activities where the focus is on movement rather than on materials. Create a simple movement game or make up your own version of a childhood classic (e.g., Red Light, Green Light) that involves using their language and AAC skills. If you’re working on core words, for example, students can move forward when they say or hear one of their target words (Green Light) and stop when they hear another kind of word (Red Light).  Get creative and change the ‘rules’ of the game so that it suits your purposes: AAC learning and engagement. Once you’ve done it a few times, the AAC learners will know what to expect and are likely to participate more readily.\nDevelop routines using fingerplays (for the littles) or gestures/pantomime (for a more age-respectful version). Use the classics such as Open, Shut Them, 2 Little Blackbirds, and Where is Thumbkin or make up your own (click here for more fingerplay ideas). Coactive movement activities, like Row Row Row Your Boat, and songs with movement (think The Grand Old Duke of York) may work for older children, too. Modify them to suit your own purposes so that there are practice opportunities for target words/sentences and use extra pause time to elicit participation.\nToss or roll your way to AAC language practice! Create communication opportunities around a corn hole board and use AAC before/after tossing those bean bags. Even simpler, create a ‘game board’ on the floor by taping AAC symbols down. We can make a sentence with the word that our bean bag landed on to practice saying our target words. If your students can deal with materials placed at a distance, you can tape the symbols to plastic bowling pins and make sentences with the words that you knocked down. \nSecure the materials to the table. Packing tape can keep a communication board in place so that it is available for modeling and communication. Use dry-erase markers or painters’ tape to outline roads and parking spaces for the cars (like this). Or use them to ‘draw’ rooms of a building so that you can do pretend play with character toys, dolls, and animals. Print out emoji images with different facial expressions and accessories. Tape them to the table top so that we can talk about them and play with them. In one session, we created an emoji ‘pathway’ and as we ‘drove’ the car down the path, we stopped on each emoji to talk about how it was feeling, what it was wearing, etc.  \nTake photos together. Even the most reluctant participants tend to like to take photos and see pictures of themselves and scenes from their daily experiences. Most therapists/teachers use a phone to do this but don’t overlook the cameras built into some of the SGDs and mobile devices. Take photos of yourselves in action, the parts of the classroom/therapy room, close-ups of learning materials and toys, views from the window, etc. Think of all the language that we can use as we narrate our picture-taking experience and slow down to elicit comments from our friends who are learning to communicate with AAC! The possibilities are endless. Plus, once you have the photos, you can create collages, add filters, and use them to make books. Even children who don’t care much for ‘regular’ books tend to really engage with books that feature the people, places, and things that they see in everyday life.\nDo you have tips for working with learning learners who need us to keep the external materials to a minimum? We’d love to hear about them.'),(26,'AAC clinicians are a creative bunch. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit some colleagues and was excited to see how they are repurposing free/low cost apps to build engagement and interaction in learners with significant communication challenges. Many of us work with learners who are highly motivated by mobile devices and apps that make music or sound, but still have a way to go to build their skills in using them. For some, we find that using apps that are relatively simple and easy (both motorically and cognitively), can spice up a session.\n\nHere are some sound/music cause and effect apps to explore. Of course, these apps are intended for a purpose completely different than how we are using them in therapy.

In this post, Tina How I Do It: Classroom Support for Students with AAC Needs by Tina Morenoshares some of the strategies that she has used to support AAC students in their classrooms. If you are a school-based SLP, don’t miss Tina’s classroom observation form for gathering data on how AAC is being used in various activities and lessons.\n\nGIVE THEM FIVE\n\nAs an SLP in the school setting, helping teachers support students in the classroom can be a big challenge.  While we can see students making progress in our therapy sessions, it can be difficult to get the same results in the classroom.  An important role of the SLP is to collaborate with teachers to help students generalize these skills in conversation with their peers and other adults throughout the school.  These are five strategies are designed for SLPs to help classroom teachers encourage and motivate their students to practice using their voices beyond the therapy room:\n\nGive the student access to words all the time\nIt can be nerve wracking for adults to worry about communication systems in accident-prone settings such as playgrounds, gym class and the cafeteria.  While some communication systems are more expensive than others, every voice is priceless.  Still, children need to have access wherever communication happens.  For typical communicators, that’s everywhere and we should have the same expectations for children who use AAC.  That means getting creative, especially for children who are ambulatory. Ideas include adding a shoulder strap to a PECS book or fashioning a mobile cart to transport an AAC device independently. Teams should develop a plan to ensure the student has access to the communication system all the time.\n\nKeep things motivating\nIn the school setting – and everywhere else for that matter – there is a great deal of emphasis placed on encouraging ALL students to answer questions.  Generally, children who use AAC are often in danger of becoming RESPONDERS.   They learn how to navigate their communication systems to answer the questions posed to them, but they often struggle to initiate conversation, ask a question or just interject something spontaneously.  Adults, including teachers and para-educators, should be encouraged to model communication with the student’s system for a variety of purposes.  SLPs will likely need to model for the other adults as well.  The more familiar the entire team becomes with a child’s communication system, the easier and more natural it becomes for everyone.\n\nThe key is developing motivating activities that encourage social communication and language learning.  This may include shared reading activities and many others, including:\n\n20 Questions\nJeopardy\nPoem writing\nTreasure hunts\nRory’s Story Cubes (storycubes.com)\nApples to Apples\nBarrier activities using Legos, blocks and other building materials\nReading and publishing books on Tar Heel Reader (tarheelreader.org)\nHedbanz\nCreate many opportunities across settings with a multitude of communication partners\nIt takes a village.  A child who uses AAC to communicate must practice with a wide range of communication partners in many, many settings.  That means that the training SLPs need to provide must extend beyond the classroom.  It should include bus drivers, cafeteria personnel, recess monitors, librarians, custodians, principals, nurses, secretaries and more.  It is not necessary to spend a great deal of time teaching all these individuals the ins and outs of each student’s individual communication system. However, every adult (and peer, for that matter) should learn the basics of communicating with an AAC user, such as:\n\nBe patient\nAsk open-ended questions\nWait (more on this later)\nAlways presume competence and intelligence\nSpeak directly to the individual, not through a nearby adult or caregiver\nLook for opportunities for your student to get involved in the school community using his own voice in different ways.  Ensure that your student gets turns making announcements, reciting the Pledge, performing in school plays, introducing  band and choir performances, delivering the morning news, working in the school store, volunteering in the library, sharing a daily joke and delivering mail to the office.  The more practice, the more competent the student will become.  An equally important side effect of all this practice will be an increased comfort level and familiarity of the entire school population when it comes to listening to your student and responding to what is said.\n\nWait for it\nStudents who communicate with AAC need time to formulate what they want to say.  In the fast-paced classroom setting, it can be challenging for teachers to provide the wait time that is needed.  Peers often want to “help” and eagerly jump in to answer for their friends. Help develop a system for your students to let their communication partners know they have something to say and need time to speak.  This might be a prestored message such as “Give me a minute to say something” or a simple gesture to ask for more time.  One friend utilized a switch to activate a blue light to raise his hand in class. When one student glanced at her PODD book, it was always presumed that she had something to say and that she needed a communication partner to sit down and help her formulate her message.\n\nTeachers must sometimes create time for students to formulate their messages so that their words could be delivered in “real time” when called upon.  For example, prior to discussion time, one teacher assigned questions to students by pulling out Popsicle sticks with individual names written on them.  After the questions were assigned, all of the students were given time to prepare their answers before responding.  Members of the team should brainstorm on ways to provide an appropriate pace for each student.\n\nRespond to communication efforts\nAll children communicate in many different ways and AAC communicators are no different.  It often takes time for children still learning to use their alternative voices to truly understand the power of their communication.  It is important for everyone in the school setting to acknowledge every communication attempt.  This is another example of the importance of the team effort in the hectic classroom setting.  Teachers need to rely on the ears and eyes of other adults and peers in the classroom in order to acknowledge and respond to all the ways a child communicates.\n\nLet’s face it. We can’t always be in the classroom to observe our students.  At the same time, we need to collect data regarding their initiation of communication and collect language samples across settings and communication partners.  The image below is of an observation form designed specifically for early communicators. This form can be completed by any of the adults working with your student.  It can be completed daily or on a schedule determined by the team. Click on the image (or visit the AAC eToolbox, under AAC Tools) to download.\n\n'),(28,'An essential part of the model we shared for AAC semantic intervention is Step 2, teaching the new words with explicit instruction activities. In our posts, explicit instruction refers to the process of designing and using carefully planned sequence of empirically-supported teaching activities. Though focused on reading, not vocabulary, development, this PowerPoint presentation by Dr. Anita Archer gives an excellent overview of the characteristics of explicit instruction.\n\nIn our initial teaching of new words, we to be sure that the learners have frequent opportunities to respond: Active participation is critical at this point. We have to give the learner a lot of opportunities to say the word (e.g.,“resume”) and tell about it (e.g., “keep going,” “start again and not stop,” “verb”, etc.). We want to elicit a lot of responses so that we can monitor their performance. That allows us to provide feedback that is affirmative when the learners respond correctly (e.g., “Good! You remembered that we kept going after the announcements-we resumed our word work”), and corrective feedback when their responses miss the mark. We try to keep the pace as brisk as we can given the needs of the learner, as that tends to help keep them engaged. Since we’re trying to get a lot of word practice in rather quickly, it helps to have response mode that is easy for the learner to produce.\n\nExplicit instruction follows a period of focused (aided) language stimulation, where the word is first introduced, explained using a student-friendly definition, and linked with known words, personal experiences, etc. Depending on the level of the learner, we may then need to engage them in Active Learning Experiences to make the word meaning come to life.Explicitly Speaking: Vocabulary Teaching in AAC\n\nActive Language Experiences: Learners who are at the earlier stages of language development need hands-on, concrete experiences to make word meaning clear. For these learners, explicit instruction begins with a variety of activities designed around the specific words. We’re all used to these kinds of activities: holding ice and tasting popsicles as we talk about ‘cold;’ racing cars and running around to talk about ‘fast,’ etc. Many of you do this all the time, particularly with younger kids. One quick point: Contrast is important here. Cold alone is okay, but cold contrasted with warm or hot really makes the point clear. Running fast is okay, but slowing it down, then speeding up is even better. And all the while, finding ways to say the target words, using aided language input, when possible. Not all learners need this level of concreteness in an activity, but many benefit from it.\n\nBeyond that, we can use a variety of other activities that are more indirect and allow us to have metalingistic Explicitly Speaking: Vocabulary Teaching in AACconversations. Here are some examples of other kinds activities that we might do in as we move into explicit instruction.\n\nYou Be The Judge: Learner listens as we use the word in sentences and judges whether we are correct or incorrect using a quick signal (e.g., thumbs up/down; yes/no message, visual support with right/wrong, etc.).\nTarget Word Collage: Learner is given a set of pictures or words some of which are positive examples of the new word and some of which are clearly not. We go through this together and discuss whether each one belongs in the collage we’re making for the target word.  \nVocabulary Sort: As in the collage activity, the learner is given a set of pictures or words that are or are not associated with the target word. He/she is also given categories so that the pictures can be sorted (e.g., abundant/not abundant; hostile/not hostile; rapid/not rapid) Together, we sort the pictures, discussing why we believe they go into one category or the other.\nVocabulary Sort with Antonyms: Same as above but using words with opposite meanings (e.g., abundant/scarce, hostile/friendly; rapid/slow)\nYou Decide: The learner is given sticky notes with the target word on them (e.g., “effort”). Together, we go through a book, magazine, or other materials and discuss whether that page/image should be labelled with the target word.\nYes/No Questions: Ask Yes/No questions in which the learner has to know the meaning of the target word in order to answer it correctly. E.g., “Should you ASSUME that all dogs are friendly? [why/why not?] “Is it a good idea to eat RAPIDLY?  [why/why not?] “Would your mom be happy if you had an ABUNDANCE of bad grades?”  [why/why not?]  \nRating Scales: Use scales with a continuum of responses (e.g., love it/okay/hate it; always/sometimes/never) to answer questions about key words (e.g., “How would you feel if..Your dad was persuaded to buy a TV?; Your friend berated you?; Your teacher produced a very hard test?”).  \nFor vocabulary instruction to really be robust, we have to give our AAC learners A LOT of these kinds of experiences. Explicit instruction isn’t over when we’ve done one or two activities. Most learners will need repetition with variety.\n\nOne Very Important Note: With all of these activities, the key to making them useful for true vocabulary learning is the dialogue. Just sorting the pictures into piles is a task, but when we use that task as a context for conversation about a word, deeper learning results. The learning comes not from the activity itself, but the dialogue around the activity.  \n\n“That’s fine for some kids, but my learner won’t understand.” That’s something we hear a lot, and I’m not quite sure how to answer it delicately. Let me just say this: My guess is that more kids have been harmed by us underestimating their abilities than the reverse. It is true that they may not understand. But they won’t ever get to the point of understanding unless we teach them. So, if you’re worried about them not understanding, there are two things you can do: Increase the amount of vocabulary instruction and increase the amount of aided language input. Both will help boost the learner’s comprehension.'),(30,'Here in the US, many schools just let out for summer vacation but some special education teachers and SLPs are already thinking about things they want to prepare over the school break so they’ll be ready for fall. Some are contemplating changes to the ways they support AAC in the classroom. We’ve heard from several who are planning to prioritize modeling of core vocabulary using aided language input.\n\nBefore we start making large core boards and other support materials, though, it’s helpful to stop and think through some important issues. A little planning now will save time and effort in the long run. If you’re planning to do this kind of prep work over the summer, here are some questions for your team to consider.\n\nDoes each student with complex communication needs have access to an AAC system that includes core vocabulary? If not, why not?\nIn some cases, the students would actually benefit from this approach but don’t yet have an appropriate AAC system. In those situations, we want to develop some sort of strategy to get them access to the kind of AAC they need. We may need to start the school year with a ‘bandaid’ system, but let’s at least make it a good bandaid, and commit to working toward a better solution as the year progresses.\nIn other cases, core vocabulary may not be the best ‘next step’ for a student. That’s fine, but let’s be sure these students have access to the kind of AAC that best meets their needs. AAC is not a one-size-fits-all proposition and a core vocabulary approach is not the answer for all learners. Still, it’s up to us to ensure that those students’ needs are addressed.\nWhich language representation systems (vocabulary, layout, symbols) are the students using? The easiest situation is one in which all the students are using the same AAC system, but that doesn’t always happen. In those cases, it’s important for the team to dialogue about how they’ll support the students’ individual systems.\nWhat do the systems have in common? For example, do they use the same symbol set? Do they use the modified Fitzgerald Key or some other approach to language organization? Which core words does the AAC system contain?\nIs it possible to create one large board for modeling, or does the class need individual boards due to the range of the students’ AAC systems?\nHow will we decide which core words to prioritize?\nHow do we integrate work on core vocabulary with the other kinds of words that students need to learn and use?\nWhat is our plan for rolling out this approach? How will we get all the staff on board?\nHow will we expand our modeling to include new core words over time?\nWhat can we do to keep everyone energized and motivated to use AAC as they move throughout the day?\nThere are no simple answers to these questions but having the conversation gets everyone focused in the same direction.'),(31,'When we first started writing about core vocabulary, it was largely due to the fact that most SGDs, AAC apps, and communication boards/ books had two big deficits. At the time, most of them lacked the words needed to function throughout the day and/or didn’t have the kinds of words that allow for progression of syntactic skills. Now things look very different. Over the years, the pendulum has moved quite dramatically and now core vocabulary permeates AAC systems that are considered to be ‘robust.’\n\nThat’s a lot of movement in a short period of time.\n\nWhen big changes happen rapidly, it stands to reason that there will be some cracks that open up. Misunderstandings, misinterpretations, misconceptions.\n\nHere are some of the ones we’ve observed in the recent past.\n\nCore words are all that are needed in an AAC system. (Not in most cases. We all want to talk about the specific things in our lives – people, places, things. We can survive without those specific words, but why would we want to?!)\nIt’s a developmental word list. (Not at all. Core word lists are frequency lists. They tell how often people in a certain age group used different words. The lists don’t tell us anything about which words were learned first by this group.)\nPeople need to be able to match pictures or receptively identify them in order to learn core words. (Not if there is good system design that honors the motor plan.)\nThey’re the first words that should be taught to people with complex communication needs. (Not necessarily. For some learners, the initial path to successful communication is paved with the words representing specific things, people, and activities that they love.)\nThey’re too abstract for learners with intellectual disabilities. (Nope. Not supported by the evidence.)\nCore vocabulary plays a critical role for most people with complex communication needs, but it isn’t everything.'),(32,'This guide contains key elements for symbol-based Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) users to become successful communicators. Use it to help set priorities, plan next steps, find more information and problem solve.\n\nDownload the Learn AAC Guide (PDF)\n\nSetting up for AAC\nPresume competence\nWe presume competence. Presuming competence affects how we make choices around Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), and how we provide opportunities and access to words, communication functions and the alphabet. Presuming competence also means that there are no prerequisite skills or age requirements to start using AAC.\nSelect a balanced AAC system\nSelect a balanced AAC system, based on core words with quick access to fringe vocabulary, and the alphabet\nChoosing a grid size\nChoose a grid size based on what the AAC user can see and touch, not based on cognitive skills, receptive language or what we think the AAC user can do.\nPersonalize vocabulary and system\nPersonalize the vocabulary so the AAC user has access to important words. Customize the system settings to meet the AAC user’s needs.\nMake AAC always available\nMake every environment set up for instant access to AAC. AAC should always be available. Consider cases, straps, paper-based copies as well as having the device charged and turned on.\nGet the team on board\nAll members of the team know about AAC and are ready and willing to be a part of AAC learning.\nPlan for AAC throughout the day\nLook at routines and make a plan for where, when and how AAC can be integrated in the day.\nStarting communication\nStart modeling\nPoint to words on the AAC system as we talk to the AAC user. Model regularly throughout the day. Model different reasons to communicate - not just requests. Model in conversations and natural interactions.\nActivity-specific vs using balance vocabulary\nUse core words and fringe folders, rather than creating activity specific boards for everything.\nConsider communication functions\nWhen we consider communication functions, we can plan and then model words that will build language and meaningful communication. We can expand an AAC user’s world beyond choice-making!\nBuild Communication Partner skills\nCommunication Partners will model words on the AAC system. We wait, prompt & respond to the AAC users attempts at communication. We make comments, rather than ask questions and accept all forms of communication.\nEngage and Interact\nChoose engaging and interesting activities, that give the AAC user motivation to communicate. Create opportunities for communication. Model on the AAC system during conversations and everyday interactions.\nBuilding language and communication\nLearn about core word teaching strategies\nStrategies for teaching core words can include: planning core words based on activities or communication functions, teaching using the Core Word of the week, or using the Descriptive Teaching Model.\nTeach Grammar\nConsider ways to teach combining words and grammar to AAC users who are ready.\nIntegrating comprehensive literacy instruction\nIntegrate communication learning alongside comprehensive literacy instruction for AAC users. This includes providing opportunities for learning sounds/letters, reading, spelling and writing.\nGet practical ideas for building language\nWe need to have bank of ideas and materials that support continued modeling and AAC learning. These ideas will build language and communication for AAC users.\nReview and reflect\nReview and monitor progress. Reflect and make changes. Take videos. Try new things and continuing to push AAC without giving up!\nPotential Roadblocks to success\nGive up too soon\nDo not give up too soon! Be persistent! Make a plan for success. Celebrate successes.\nLack of support in different environments\nMake AAC available in those different environments. Support it by working with teams. Collect evidence to share.\nStalled at choice-making and requesting\nDo not limit language by only offering choices. Instead model language for different communication functions.\nDifferent AAC Systems in one environment\nTeams need to get to know the systems. They need more flexibility to fast switch between systems. Often, AAC users are more flexible than the environment!\nAAC will stop a person learning to speak\nResearch shows that AAC can have positive effects on speech and language development, and does not stop an AAC user learning to speak.\nAAC users are required to prove themselves\nWe should be presuming competence and not requiring any prerequisite skills before they can be eligible for a full balanced AAC system.'),(33,'Implementing Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is not easy so we created a poster and overview series of blog posts about the do\'s and don\'ts of implementing AAC.\n\nThere are practices in AAC implementation that lead to better outcomes for every individual with complex communication needs.\n\nThere are also practices that lead to poorer outcomes for those same individuals. As we always focus on communication for all, we felt it was important to address both the do\'s and don\'ts together. Sometimes addressing only the good practices might mean the bad ones don’t get tackled too!\n\nBelow we list the essential do\'s and don\'ts with accompanying blog posts or articles to read for more in-depth information.\n\nDo\'s\nDon\'ts\nUse the AAC system to talk yourself\nExpect the AAC user to communicate without you modelling how\nAim high	Demand prerequisite skills\nUse a well designed, comprehensive vocabulary (core vocabulary or PODD)\nProvide an AAC system with only a handful of choices\nProvide wait time	Do all the talking\nAsk open-ended questions\nAsk questions the AAC user knows you already know the answer to\nFocus on key words when modeling\nThink you always need to model grammatically correct sentences\nRespect multi-modal communication\nSay \"now use your talker\"\nAllow exploration and access to the whole vocabulary\nCreate custom pages for specific activities\nMake sure AAC is available all day, every day\nLimit access to the AAC system\nDescribe what you want to say using core words\nFocus on adding lots of vocabulary\n\nRemember, communication is a human right, fundamental to literacy development and participation in education, and occurs all day, every day. We are all responsible for making sure this happens for everyone.'),(34,'Providing enough time to people who use AAC is very important, as using AAC to communicate takes time. We as communication partners need to provide enough of it for the person using AAC to claim their turn in the conversation, to process what was said and what they want to say and then compose their message.\n\nThere is a reason why providing wait time appears on so many lists of supports and interventions for AAC users. All people who use AAC, whether young and just learning or accomplished adult, need enough time. Using AAC to communicate takes time and we as communication partners need to provide enough of it for the person using AAC to claim their turn in the conversation, to process what was said and what they want to say and then compose their message.\n\nThis one should be easy but for so many of us, it’s hard and takes practice. Regardless of whether the AAC is an app on an iPad, a dedicated device or a sheet of paper, it takes time and it’s up to us to make sure that it is provided.\n\nThe perfect pause\nIn her PrAACtical AAC article, On Not Talking, Carole Zangari describes it as the “perfect pause”. She reminds us, “There is power in the perfect pause.”\n\nWhy provide enough wait time?\n\nTo let the user know it’s their turn\nTo provide time for the user to process what you said\nTo give the user time to take their turn\nAnd it works! A study by Hilary Johanna Mathis entitled “The effect of pause time upon the communicative interactions of young people who use augmentative and alternative communication”, demonstrated that when a communication partner provides pause time, the AAC user is more likely to claim their turn and respond with more words. This study suggests that providing a wait time (up to 45 seconds) supports users to claim more conversations turns and use more words.\n\nNow that we have convinced you how important it is to pause and wait, we would like to share information with siblings and peers so they, too can become a more supportive communication partner:\n\nWhen you’re talking with a sibling or friend who uses AAC, patience is key. A conversation is going to take longer because they have more things they need to do.\nFor siblings and peers\nWhat do Star Wars and AAC have in common? Jedi training, of course! When Anakin began his training under Obi-Wan, the first and most important thing he had to learn was patience. And when you’re talking with a sibling or friend who uses AAC, patience is key. A conversation is going to take longer because they have more things they need to do. You think about what you\'re going to say and your brain tells your mouth to move and say it. They think about what they\'re going to say, their brain tells them what they need to move to use their talker or board, and then they need to remember what page to go to, get there, possibly spell things out, all while not forgetting what they wanted to say and how to say it. It\'s slow going. Worth it, but slow going. With that in mind, here are some tips on how to be an excellent communication partner, Jedi style.\n\nPractice being a good listener. Look them in the eye and focus on them and your conversation.\nAsk lots of open-ended questions. Do you ask all your friends just yes or no questions? Of course not! That would be boring. Rather than asking, “Do you like Rey?,” try, “Who’s your favorite character in Star Wars?” After you\'ve asked, time for that patience to come out.\nWait for them to talk, don\'t say a word, and keep looking at them. Show how interested you are. Count to five in your head (One Mississippi, Two Mississippi…). That feels like a long time, but it\'s okay.\nIf they haven\'t begun starting their answer, glance down at their talker and smile encouragingly. This is a prompt, or reminder, that they should be taking their turn.\nStill nothing? Give them an idea. \"I like Finn and Leia a lot, but Rey is my favorite. She’s such a great fighter! What about you?\" Then start the waiting over again. (See what I said about patience? It takes practice, but you\'ll get the hang of it!)\nNot all communication is spoken - respond to it all. Did they make a horrified face when you mentioned Finn, Leia or Rey? That’s an answer, too! “Wait, you don’t like Leia? Why not?!” They better have a very good answer to that question. Wait for it.\nIf they are answering, well, keep up the good work! Keep the conversation moving, each of you taking turns.\nThat’s not the only way you can be an excellent communication partner, though. For example, sometimes you\'ll be hanging out with your friend or sibling, and someone comes over with a question. But instead of asking your friend about their talker, they turn to YOU and ask. Don\'t let them get away with this! Smile and tell them, \"Oh, Jack\'s the one you want to talk to. Ask him!\" or \"I\'ll let Jack explain.\" This is called being a facilitator. Let him do the talking and explaining. It is his talker, after all. * You can stand behind your friend or sibling, but try not to look at the person who came over. You want to encourage them to talk to him, not you. It can take patience to show new people how to be a good communication partner, but it’s important. * If they need help remembering what page something is on, or how to say something, you can lean down and whisper into their ear or point to the board. This is only if they really need help, though, and after showing off your patience and silent counting. And there you have it! With just a bit of Jedi patience, it’ll be no time before you’re debating whether Han shot first.');
