INSERT INTO `crawled_raw_data` VALUES (4,'MARY MUSGRAVE, By Anonymous\n\n\n“Nine carets ef it’s a blessed one.”\n\n“Scale ‘im, an’ ye’ll find he’s a half better. Clear es a bottle o’\ngin, an’ flawless es the pope! Tommy Dartmoor, ye’re in luck, s’ welp me\nnever ef ye ain’t, an’ that’s a brilliant yer can show the polis an’ not\nget time fer.”\n\nTommy Dartmoor, who owed his surname to a crown establishment within the\nrestraining walls of which he had once enjoyed a temporary residence,\ngrowled out a recommendation to “stow that,” and then added, “Boys,\nwe’ll wet this. Trek to Werstein’s.”\n\nForthwith a crowd of dirty, tanned diggers turned their heads in the\ndirection of Gustav Werstein’s American Bar, and walked toward it as\nbriskly as the heat and their weariness would admit of. The Israelite\nsaw them coming, straightened himself out of the half-doze in which\nhe had passed the baking afternoon, stopped down the tobacco in the\nporcelain bowl of his long-stemmed pipe with stumpy forefinger, and,\ntwisting a cork off his corkscrew, stood in readiness.\n\n“Name yer pizons, boys, an’ get outside ‘em, wishin’ all good luck to\nR’yal Straight; R’yal Straight bein’ the name o’ this yer stone given by\nThomas D. Hesquire, original diskiverer an’ present perprietor.”\n\nThe orders were given,--bass at five shillings a bottle, champagne\n(nee gooseberry) at five pounds, Cape smoke at two shillings per two\nfingers,--and, at a given signal, there was an inarticulate roar from\ndusty throats, an inversion of tumblers over thirsty mouths, and a\nsecond inversion over the ground to show that all the contents had\ndisappeared.\n\nSatan, the one cat and only domestic pet of the camp, saw that there was\na general treat going on, and bustling up for his drink took a can of\ncondensed milk at six shillings. Other diggers came trooping in as the\nnews spread, and Tommy Dartmoor, who was rapidly becoming mellow, for\nhe drank half a tumbler of raw whisky with every one who nodded to\nhim, stood them refreshments galore, while the greasy Jew began to see\nvisions of his adopted fatherland in the near distance.\n\nSo the Kaffirs, except those who had supplies of their own, kept sober\nand peaceful, while the higher order of the human race at Big Stone\nHole, after the manner of their kind, began to squabble. It was natural\nfor them to do so, perhaps, for the weather was so hot, and the liquors,\nfor the most part, more so; and under these circumstances men do not\nalways cast about them long for a casus belli. One or two minor brawls\nopened the ball, and Herr Gustav, scenting battle in the air, drew from\na locker a card, which he balanced against the bottles on a shelf above\nhis head. It read thus:\n\n     GENTS IS REKESTED TO SHOOT\n     CLEAR OF THE BARR-KEP.\n     BROKIN GLAS MAY BE PADE FOR\n     AT COST PRISE.\n\nand had been written for the German by a gentleman who had had\nsome experience in Forty Rod Gulch, Nevada. The action elicited a\ncontemptuous laugh from one or two of the new hands, but the oldsters\nbegan shifting sundry articles which depended from their belts into\npositions from which they might be handled at the shortest notice;\nand the black cat, more wise than any of them, having drunk his fill,\nstalked solemnly out into the security of the darkness.\n\nThe sun went down,--went out with a click, some one declared,--and,\nas no twilight interposed between daylight and darkness in the country\nwhich Big Stone Hole ornamented, Herr Gustav lit his two paraffin-lamps.\nNeither boasted more than a one-inch wick, and, as their glasses were\nextremely smoky, the illumination was not brilliant; but it sufficed to\nshow the flushed, angry faces of a couple of men standing in the centre\nof the room, with all the others clustered round, watching eagerly. One\nwas the Scholar. The other was a burly giant, whose missing left little\nfinger caused him to be nicknamed the Cripple. About what they had\noriginally fallen out was not clear to any one, to themselves least of\nall. As the case stood when the second lamp was lit, Scholar had called\nCripple a something-or-other liar, and Cripple, who was not inventive,\nhad retorted by stigmatising Scholar as another. Further recriminations\nfollowed, and their pistols were drawn; but as the audience had a strong\nobjection to indiscriminate shooting, by which it was not likely to\nbenefit, the belligerents were seized. No one was unsportsmanlike enough\nto wish to stop the fight, and Jockey Bill, giving voice to the general\nwish of the meeting, proposed that the gents be fixed up agin’ a couple\no’ posts outside, where they might let daylight into each other without\nlead-poisoning casual spectators.\n\nThe motion was acted on, and after rectifying a slight omission on\nthe Cripple’s part--he had forgotten to put caps on the nipples of his\nrevolver--the pair of them were seated upon upturned barrels some ten\nyards apart, each with a lamp at his feet, and told to begin when they\nsaw fit to do so. The swarthy, bearded diggers grouped themselves on\neither side, and the cat, emerging from his retreat, scrambled on to\nthe shoulder of one of them, fully as curious as the rest to “see the\nshootin’.” It was a weird sight,--dust, scorched grass, empty tins, rude\nhovels, piles of debris, African moonlight,--yet, except, perhaps, in\nthe eyes of the newest comers, there was nothing strange in it. The\nothers were too wrapped up in what was going to take place to see\nanything quaint in their every-day surroundings. There was no theatre in\nthe camp. The little impromptu drama riveted all attention.\n\nBut before the duel commenced, a galloping horse, which had approached\nover the grassy veldt unnoticed during the excitement, drew up with a\ncrash between the two combatants, and its rider, raising his hand to\ncommand attention, cried:\n\n“Boys, there’s a white woman comin’!”\n\n“A white woman!” was chorused in various tones of disbelief. “What,\nhere? White woman comin’ here, Dan?”\n\nAnd then some one inquired if she was a Boer.\n\n“Boer--no,” replied Dan; “English--English as I am; leastways Englisher,\nbein’ Amurrican-born myself. Overtook her et Hottentot Drift. Thort I’d\nspur on an’ tell yer. We’d do wi’ a clean-up, some on us.”\n\nDan spoke indistinctly, as a bullet had lately disarranged some of his\nteeth; but his words had a wonderful effect.\n\nEach man began instinctively to tidy himself. The would-be duellists,\nforgetting their quarrel, stuck the revolvers in their belts and\nfollowed the general example. The Cripple hied him to the store, and\nafter breaking down the door abstracted the only blacking-brush in the\ncamp,--putting down a sovereign on the counter in exchange for it,--and\nset to polishing his high boots as if a fortune depended on their\nbrightness. The Scholar bought Herr Gustav’s white shirt for a fiver,\nthreatening to murder its owner if he did not render it up. And\nPartridge, a good man from Norfolk, with a regrettable weakness for\nshooting other people’s game, induced a friend to denude him of his\nflowing locks by means of a clasp-knife and a hunk of wood, as no\nscissors were procurable.\n\nThe wardrobes of Big Stone Hole were stocked more with a view to strict\nutility than variety or ornamentation, and the slender resources of the\nstore utterly gave out under the sudden strain that was put upon them.\nIn every direction grimy, unkempt men might be seen attempting to\nbeautify themselves. Here was one enduring agonies from a razor that\nwould scarcely whittle a stick; here another recalling the feel of a\ncake of soap; there a great fellow pulling faces as he struggled to get\nthe teeth of a comb into his shock of hair; there another brushing the\nclay from his moleskin trousers with a tuft of stiff grass.\n\nIt seemed to these men ages since they had last seen a woman in\nthe flesh,--Kaffir women don’t count; they are not women, merely\nKaffirs,--and, with the natural instinct of males of every species, they\nset about pluming their feathers.\n\nThese operations, though speedy as might be, were necessarily prolonged,\nfor most of the men required several buckets of water over the head\nbefore they felt fit for such unaccustomed exercises, and they were\nscarcely finished before the creaking of wheels and the cries of the\nvoorlooper as he urged his oxen announced that the wagon was within\nearshot. Up it came, the great tilt gleaming white in the moonlight, and\nevery eye was fixed expectantly on the dark chasm within. The driver,\npuffed up with his own importance, cracked his long whip and deigned not\nto notice the men whom he usually greeted with a friendly hail, and the\nHottentot boy ahead, imitating his master, vouchsafed no explanation.\nWith more deathly slowness than usual did the lumbering vehicle crawl\nalong until the tired cattle pulled up before the door of the American\nBar. Then there was a rush and a bit of a scuffle for the honour of\nhanding the woman out. The Cripple was the fortunate man, and, after\nassisting her to the ground, waved his tattered hat toward the gleaming\nopen doorway. But he did not speak. Words were beyond him. Indeed, the\ndiggers, who were none of them particularly remarkable for taciturnity\nas a general thing, seemed, with one exception, to be stricken dumb.\nBut the Scholar proved himself equal to the occasion, and with courtly\nphrase bade the new-comer welcome to the camp. He had always been a\npopular man among women in his palmier days, though openly holding\nrather a poor opinion of them; and as the one before him now was neat\nof speech and comely of form, he was not at all averse to enjoying her\nsociety and conversation.\n\n“I should be much obliged if you would direct me to a hotel,” she said,\nafter taking a look around the cheap gaudiness of the saloon.\n\n“I’m sorry to say that we have no hotel here as yet, Miss--er--?”\n\n“Musgrave. Miss Mary Musgrave”--with a little bow. “But I heard that a\nGerman had started a hotel here.”\n\n“No; there is nothing but this. That”--pointing to Herr Gustave, who was\nregarding the newcomer with an evil eye--“that is the German.”\n\nMiss Musgrave appeared distressed.\n\n“Then where can I go?” she asked. “Are there any lodgings to be had?”\n\n“The lady may have my place,” chorused three eager voices, and every man\nin the room repeated the offer.\n\nShe thanked them with a pretty smile and one comprehensive bow, and\nlooked up at the Scholar for help.\n\n“I would offer you my hut if it were not such a wretched one. But, as\nit is, I should advise you to take this man’s”--and he pointed to Tommy\nDartmoor.\n\n“Why, mine’s twenty carats better than hisn!” exclaimed the Cripple.\n\n“And mine better ‘n either,” growled Dan.\n\n“Mine’s the best of the lot.”\n\n“No, it isn’t; mine is,” yelled others, till there was a general roar,\nwhich caused Miss Musgrave to look frightened and shrink nearer to the\nScholar, and that gentleman to raise his hand for silence.\n\n“Look here,” said he, “we’ll pick out the twelve best, and their owners\ncan cut with one another from a pack of cards.”\n\nAfter some discussion twelve were settled upon, but the number was\nimmediately raised to thirteen to prevent Jockey Bill disgracing the\ncamp by shooting before a lady. A pack of cards was placed on the bar,\nand each man chose one, holding his selection face downward till all\nwere ready. Then the Scholar said, “Turn,” and there were exhibited five\naces, two kings, a queen, three knaves, and two smaller cards. This was\nawkward, to say the least of it, and, while sarcastic laughter rippled\namong the spectators, there was an instinctive movement of right hands\ntoward the back of the belt on the part of each of the thirteen.\n\nBut the Scholar’s voice, full of remonstrance, said, “Boys, you’re being\nlooked at,” and there was a regretful sigh or two, but no bloodshed.\n\nMiss Musgrave gazed inquiringly from one to another, and the Scholar,\nlaying his hand on her arm, whispered something in her ear. She smiled,\nwhispered back, and was answered, and then, stripping off a pair of\nwell-fitting fawn gloves, she took the cards in a pretty little white\nhand, and dealt out one to each of the competitors with charming\nclumsiness.\n\n“Ain’t touched a keard afore, bless her,” whispered Euchre Buck, giving\nhis neighbor Dan a nudge in the ribs to call attention to this wonderful\npiece of girlish innocence. “Square a deal es George Washington mought\nha’ made.” Then, as the greasy pasteboards were turned up, and his\nneighbour was handed the ace of clubs, he raised his voice and yelled\nout, “Bully for you, Dan! Cut away an’ clar yer cabin out.”\n\nAway scampered Dan out into the darkness, with the rest of the crew at\nhis heels. Their home comforts were very small, poor fellows; but each\ngave of his best, though the gifts were often incongruous enough.\nIn half an hour the cabin was fitted out with a small cracked\nlooking-glass, two combs, an old hair-brush,--still wet from the\nwash,--a pail, a frying-pan, three kettles, two three-legged stools, and\nso many blankets that some were requisitioned to carpet the floor. The\nwhole crowd accompanied Miss Musgrave to her door and gave her a\ncheer by way of good-night. She bowed to them, smiling her thanks, and\nlooking, as they thought, entrancingly lovely as she stood there, with\nthe pale moonbeams falling full on her.\n\nThen she turned to go in, but as Euchre Buck stepped forward with an\nadmonishing cough, she waited and looked round at him.\n\n“Miss,” said he, holding out a big revolver in his hard fist, “you take\nthis yer gun, an’ ef any one whistles, or otherwise disturbs you, let a\nhole into him straight away, an’ we’ll see him buried decent.”\n\nBut Miss Musgrave courteously, and with profuse thanks, refused the\noffer, and, saying that she had perfect confidence in all who were\naround her, gave Euchre Buck a bewitching smile, went inside, and closed\nthe door after he.\n\nThen the diggers returned to Gustav Werstein’s American Bar and\ndiscussed the new arrival.\n\n“I known Noomarket an’ Hascot an’ Hepson, an’ all the places where\nswells goes in England,” said Jockey Bill, enthusiastically; “but never\none come there as pretty as she, stop my license if ther’ did.”\n\n“Grand eyes, hain’t she?” said Tommy Dartmoor. “Regular fust-water ‘uns.\nHere’s to ‘em!”\n\n“And-a-hoof! See it peep below her gownd. S’ welp me ef it wer’ es big\nas my ‘bacca-box!”\n\n“An’ ‘er close, gentlemen! Made to measure, every thread on ‘em, I\nallow.”\n\n“She’s a lady, boys,” exclaimed he who had offered to see after a\nfuneral, “a reg’lar slap-up, high-toned, blow-yer-eyes-don’t-touch-me\nlady; an’ as she sees fit to do the civil to this fellar”--striking\nhimself on the chest--“he’s just going to drop his professional name,\nan’ arsk yer to call him Mister Samuel K. Gregson, Esquire. Play on\nthat.”\n\nNext morning the inhabitants of Big Stone Hole were startled by reading\nthis announcement outside the cabin which Dan had resigned to Miss\nMusgrave:\n\n     SINGING AND MUSIC TAUGHT.\n     LITERARY WORK DONE.\n\nIt was printed on a card, which was affixed to the door by means of a\ndrawing-pin, and from within came the sound of a contralto voice singing\nto a guitar accompaniment. One by one the male residents of Big Stone\nHole drew near to that iron-roofed hut and stopped to listen; but after\ncommenting on the innovation in gleeful whispers--for guitar had never\ntwanged in that part of Africa before--they moved on to their work. No\nconsideration could cause them to neglect that. They might fritter away\nthe dull, rough gems when they had found them, but the lust of handling\ndiamonds once was the strongest passion they knew. And so the day’s\ntoil was not curtailed; but at the conclusion Miss Musgrave had an\napplication for instruction in music from every man in the camp, with\none exception. This one defaulter was Euchre Buck. He owned to having\nno ear for music--thereby exhibiting more honesty than many of the\nothers--and confessed to knowing only two tunes, one of which was\n“Hail Columbia,” and the other--wasn’t; and so he said he wanted some\n“literary work done.” He proposed to Miss Musgrave that she should write\na history of his life at half a guinea a page, thereby--cute Yankee that\nhe was--thinking to appropriate the whole of her time.\n\nBut embarrassed by all these calls upon her, and obviously unable to\nsatisfy each of them, Miss Musgrave turned for help to the Scholar,\nwhom she appeared to regard as her special adviser; and he, promising a\nsolution of the difficulty in half an hour, drew off the whole crowd to\nthe American Bar, where the question was thrashed out in all its points.\n\nIt was clearly evident that Miss Musgrave could not surrender to each\nindividual the whole of her evening, even if any one had been willing to\nlet his neighbor monopolise it, which no one was; and therefore it\nwas necessary to formulate some scheme by which her talents might be\ndistributed over a larger area. But what the scheme should be was not\nsettled all in a minute. One man wanted to hear her sing, another to\nhear her talk, another was willing to give five pounds an hour for the\nprivilege of talking to her. After a lengthened discussion, which was\nexcited throughout, and at times verged on the warlike, it was\ndecided to effect a compromise--subject, of course, to Miss Musgrave’s\ninclinations; and a deputation was sent to learn her views on the\nsubject.\n\nThere was no assembly-room in the place, excepting Werstein’s\nsaloon,--which, of course, was not available for such a purpose,--and so\nit was proposed to her, with much humility, that she should take up her\nposition in the evenings on a chair outside her hut, and there discourse\nsuch vocal and instrumental music as she saw fit, interlarding the\nsame with friendly conversation. What was she to talk about?\nAnything--absolutely anything. They didn’t mind what it was, so long as\nthey heard her voice. Five shillings, the committee had decided, was to\nbe paid by every man who came within earshot. And any one who wanted a\nfree list was requested to argue the matter out with Euchre Buck.\n\nThis call upon her powers seemed to take Miss Musgrave aback.\n\n“I have never sung in public,” she pleaded, rather nervously. “Indeed,\nmy voice is not good enough for it; really it isn’t. Only I thought\nI could teach a little perhaps, and that is why I came here. You see,\nmother, is an invalid, and we were so very poor that--”\n\n“Miss,” broke in Jockey Bill, “call it ten bob a ‘ead, an’ just ‘um to\nus.”\n\n“Oh no, Mr. William, it was not the money that I thought about; indeed,\nfive shillings would be far too much. But if you think that I should be\nable to amuse you at all, I would do my very best--believe me, I would.”\n\n“Miss,” growled Dan, with a clumsy endeavour to chase away her\ndiffidence, “all we asks is fer you to sit near us fer a spell. Ef you\nsings or plays, we’d be proud; ef you just looks an’ talks, we’d be\npleased.”\n\nSo in the end Miss Musgrave yielded to the wishes of the community, and\nthe nightly conclave in the American Bar became so much a thing of the\npast that Gustav Werstein was heard to threaten another emigration. The\nsongs were to the diggers new, and yet not new. There was nothing of the\nmusic-hall type about them; they were nearly all old-fashioned ditties.\nShe sang to them of “Barbara Allen” and “Sally in our Alley”; she\ngave them “Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” and called for a chorus; she sang “The\nMessage,” “The Arrow and the Song”; and she brought back memories of\nother days when Africa was to them a mere geographical expression--of\ndays when that something had not happened which had sent them away from\nhome.\n\nSunday came, the fifth day after her arrival, and it differed from the\nusual Sabbath of Big Stone Hole. Sunday had been observed before by\nthe biggest drinking bout of the week, and a summary settlement of the\nprevious six days’ disputes. Now, to the huge surprise of the Kaffirs,\nand to the still greater surprise of themselves, these diamond-diggers\nsang hymns at intervals during the day, and refrained from indulging in\nthe orthodox carouse till after Miss Musgrave had retired for the night.\nIt was a wonderful change.\n\nDuring the next week a fall of earth took place in Tommy Dartmoor’s\nclaim. Two Kaffirs were killed; and when the proprietor himself was\nextricated from the debris of blue clay which held him down, he was\nfound to have a broken arm, besides other serious injuries.\n\n“Don’t let on to her,” he managed to gasp out to his rescuers, wishing\nto spare Miss Musgrave’s nerves a shock.\n\nBut she saw the men bearing him to his hut, joined them, and insisted on\nbeing installed as sole nurse forthwith.\n\nTwenty other men would willingly have broken an arm for such a reward;\nand the recklessness displayed during the next few days was something\nawful. But she saw that too,--little escaped those big blue eyes,--and,\nascribing it to drink, gave a pretty strong lecture on the bibulous\nhabits of Big Stone Hole, at her next concert.\n\nThere was an earnest meeting in the American Bar that night, at which\nthe following motion was put and carried unanimously: “On and after this\ndate, any drunken man is liable to be shot at sight, unless his friends\ncan prove that he has dug over three carats of diamonds during the day.”\n And then, like other reformers, they went on to more sweeping measures:\n“Only knife-fighting to take place in the camp. All disputes with\npistols, unless of a very pressing nature, to be settled out of earshot\nof Dan’s house.” There were even some hints of appointing a closing-time\nfor the saloon--“it would make the place so much more like home.” But\nthe promoter eventually withdrew his suggestion, as it was justly felt\nthat such a motion would interfere with the liberty of the subject too\nmuch. But a storm of cheers burst forth when it was proposed to\ntransfer the diamond-safe from Werstein’s keeping to a corner of the new\ngoddess’s shrine.\n\nEven Satan, the cat, joined in the general adoration, and, more favoured\nthan the rest, enjoyed at times a chaste salute from Miss Musgrave’s\nripe-red lips.\n\nNever, in so short a space of time, had a community been more changed\nfor the better than was that of Big Stone Hole. Never had woman’s\nhumanising influence made itself more clearly felt. The azure cloud\nof blasphemy that hung over the workings and the rest of the camp was\nreplaced again by the normal dust. Each man tried to beautify the inside\nof his shanty to the best of his means and ideas, for there was no\nknowing when the only “she” would take it into her pretty, capricious\nhead to pay a call. In this latter line the Scholar had a decided pull.\nEducation had taught him taste; necessity, handiness; and by aid of\nthe two he transformed his rude dwelling into something approaching the\nrooms in which he used to dawdle away the happy hours, time ago. It was\npartly drawing-room, partly curiosity-shop. Cups, saucers, and spoons\nappeared as if by magicians’ call, and one blazing afternoon the news\nflashed round the diamond-pits that Miss Musgrave was “taking afternoon\ntea with the Scholar.” But when the Scholar saw the dismay his simple\nact had spread around him, he dissipated it with a kindly laugh and a\nfew reassuring words.\n\n“Don’t mind me, boys. I was only doing the civil in a purely platonic\nmanner. Miss Musgrave is nothing to me, nor am I anything to her. Heaven\nforbid! I’m too hard a bargain for any girl. If any one of you marries\nher I’ll act as his best man if he asks me to, and wish him every\nfelicity without a thought of regret.”\n\n“Bully for the Scholar!” yelled the delighted crowd; and Miss Musgrave’s\nsmiles were more sought after than ever.\n\nSo things went on day after day, week after week, till Miss Musgrave\nbecame little short of an autocratic empress. But still she showed no\nsigns of taking unto herself a consort; she kept all men at a cousinly\ndistance, and those who felt intimate enough to address her as “Miss\nMary” accounted themselves uncommonly fortunate. Thus the little machine\nof state worked perfectly harmoniously, and Big Stone Hole was as steady\nand prosperous a settlement as need be.\n\nHad these diggers refreshed their minds by looking back for historical\nparallels, they might have been prepared in some degree for Miss\nMusgrave’s exit from among them, but as none of them indulged in such\nretrospections the manner of it took the camp somewhat by surprise.\n\nIt was first discovered in this wise. Work was over for the day. The\nKaffirs had been searched and had returned to their kraal. Pipes\nwere being lit after the evening meal, and a picturesque assembly was\ngrouping itself in an expectant semicircle on the sun-baked turf in\nfront of Miss Musgrave’s dwelling. She was usually outside to welcome\nthe first comers, and her absence naturally formed the staple topic\nof conversation. Digger after digger arrived, threw himself down, and\njoined in the general wonderment as to why Miss Mary wasn’t there, and\nat last some one hazarded a suggestion that she “must be asleep.” There\nwas a general epidemic of noisy coughing for a full minute, and then\nsilence for another, but no sound from within the hut.\n\n“Perhaps she’s ill,” was the next surmise.\n\nAfter the etiquette to be followed had been strictly discussed, and a\nrigid course of procedure set down, the Scholar got up and knocked at\nthe door. He received no answer, and so knocked again--knocked several\ntimes, in fact, and then rattled the handle vigorously, but without\nresult.\n\n“Better open it,” said a voice.\n\nAnd he did so; and after looking inside, announced:\n\n“She’s not there.”\n\nAt this moment Dan came up.\n\n“My ole mar’ ‘s gone,” he said; “an’ she ain’t stampeded, neither, but\nwas stole. Tote-rope’s been untied, an’ saddle an’ bridle took as well.”\n\nThere was uncomfortable silence, which the Scholar broke by a low,\nlong-drawn whistle.\n\n“Boys,” said he, “let’s look inside the safe.”\n\nThe three men who held the keys brought them up, the bolts were shot,\nand the massive door swung back. There was every man’s little sack with\nhis name on it; but somehow or other the sacks looked limper than of\nyore. Each one was eagerly clutched and examined, and many a groan and\nnot a few curses went up on the still night air as it was found that\nevery sack save Dan’s had been relieved of the more valuable part of its\ncontents.\n\nSo much heart-breaking labour under the burning sun thrown away for\nnothing; the dreary work to commence afresh, almost from the beginning!\nHad the thief been any ordinary one, the denunciation would have\nbeen unbounded; but no one lifted his tongue very loudly against Mary\nMusgrave. Yet mounted men were despatched on the three trails to bring\nback the booty if possible, and the rest moved dejectedly toward their\nold club. The greasy Jew did not attempt to conceal his exultation. He\nserved his customers with his wicked old face glowing with smiles, and\nwhen a moment’s breathing-time came he observed:\n\n“We all ‘az hour lettle surbrizes in dis wairld, an’ I most confaiss I\nam asdonished myself to lairn that Mess Mosgrave is a thief--” But here\na crashing among the glassware announced that Tommy Dartmoor had begun\nshooting with his left hand, and Herr Gustave sputtered out from behind\nthe fingers he held before his face, “Ach Gott! I say nozzing more!”'),(5,'THE MYSTERY OF SASASSA VALLEY, By A. Conan Doyle\n\n\nDo I know why Tom Donahue is called “Lucky Tom”? Yes, I do; and that is\nmore than one in ten of those who call him so can say. I have knocked\nabout a deal in my time, and seen some strange sights, but none stranger\nthan the way in which Tom gained that sobriquet, and his fortune with\nit. For I was with him at the time. Tell it? Oh, certainly; but it is a\nlongish story and a very strange one; so fill up your glass again, and\nlight another cigar, while I try to reel it off. Yes, a very strange\none; beats some fairy stories I have heard; but it’s true, sir, every\nword of it. There are men alive at Cape Colony now who’ll remember it\nand confirm what I say. Many a time has the tale been told round the\nfire in Boers’ cabins from Orange state to Griqualand; yes, and out in\nthe bush and at the diamond-fields too.\n\nI’m roughish now, sir; but I was entered at the Middle Temple once, and\nstudied for the bar. Tom--worse luck!--was one of my fellow-students;\nand a wildish time we had of it, until at last our finances ran short,\nand we were compelled to give up our so-called studies, and look about\nfor some part of the world where two young fellows with strong arms and\nsound constitutions might make their mark. In those days the tide of\nemigration had scarcely begun to set in toward Africa, and so we thought\nour best chance would be down at Cape Colony. Well,--to make a long\nstory short,--we set sail, and were deposited in Cape Town with less\nthan five pounds in our pockets; and there we parted. We each tried our\nhands at many things, and had ups and downs; but when, at the end of\nthree years, chance led each of us up-country and we met again, we were,\nI regret to say, in almost as bad a plight as when we started.\n\nWell, this was not much of a commencement; and very disheartened we\nwere, so disheartened that Tom spoke of going back to England and\ngetting a clerkship. For you see we didn’t know that we had played out\nall our small cards, and that the trumps were going to turn up. No; we\nthought our “hands” were bad all through. It was a very lonely part of\nthe country that we were in, inhabited by a few scattered farms, whose\nhouses were stockaded and fenced in to defend them against the Kaffirs.\nTom Donahue and I had a little hut right out in the bush; but we were\nknown to possess nothing, and to be handy with our revolvers, so we\nhad little to fear. There we waited, doing odd jobs, and hoping that\nsomething would turn up. Well, after we had been there about a month\nsomething did turn up upon a certain night, something which was the\nmaking of both of us; and it’s about that night, sir, that I’m going to\ntell you. I remember it well. The wind was howling past our cabin, and\nthe rain threatened to burst in our rude window. We had a great wood\nfire crackling and sputtering on the hearth, by which I was sitting\nmending a whip, while Tom was lying in his bunk groaning disconsolately\nat the chance which had led him to such a place.\n\n“Cheer up, Tom--cheer up,” said I. “No man ever knows what may be\nawaiting him.”\n\n“Ill luck, ill luck, Jack,” he answered. “I always was an unlucky dog.\nHere have I been three years in this abominable country; and I see lads\nfresh from England jingling the money in their pockets, while I am as\npoor as when I landed. Ah, Jack, if you want to keep your head above\nwater, old friend, you must try your fortune away from me.”\n\n“Nonsense, Tom; you’re down in your luck to-night. But hark! Here’s some\none coming outside. Dick Wharton, by the tread; he’ll rouse you, if any\nman can.”\n\nEven as I spoke the door was flung open, and honest Dick Wharton, with\nthe water pouring from him, stepped in, his hearty red face looming\nthrough the haze like a harvest-moon. He shook himself, and after\ngreeting us sat down by the fire to warm himself.\n\n“Where away, Dick, on such a night as this?” said I. “You’ll find the\nrheumatism a worse foe than the Kaffirs, unless you keep more regular\nhours.”\n\nDick was looking unusually serious, almost frightened, one would say,\nif one did not know the man. “Had to go,” he replied--“had to go. One\nof Madison’s cattle was seen straying down Sasassa Valley, and of course\nnone of our blacks would go down _that_ valley at night; and if we had\nwaited till morning, the brute would have been in Kaffirland.”\n\n“Why wouldn’t they go down Sasassa Valley at night?” asked Tom.\n\n“Kaffirs, I suppose,” said I.\n\n“Ghosts,” said Dick.\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n“I suppose they didn’t give such a matter-of-fact fellow as you a sight\nof their charms?” said Tom, from the bunk.\n\n“Yes,” said Dick, seriously, “yes; I saw what the niggers talk about;\nand I promise you, lads, I don’t want ever to see it again.”\n\nTom sat up in his bed. “Nonsense, Dick; you’re joking, man! Come, tell\nus all about it; the legend first, and your own experience afterward.\nPass him over the bottle, Jack.”\n\n“Well, as to the legend,” began Dick. “It seems that the niggers have\nhad it handed down to them that Sasassa Valley is haunted by a frightful\nfiend. Hunters and wanderers passing down the defile have seen its\nglowing eyes under the shadows of the cliff; and the story goes\nthat whoever has chanced to encounter that baleful glare has had his\nafter-life blighted by the malignant power of this creature. Whether\nthat be true or not,” continued Dick, ruefully, “I may have an\nopportunity of judging for myself.”\n\n“Go on, Dick--go on,” cried Tom. “Let’s hear about what you saw.”\n\n“Well, I was groping down the valley, looking for that cow of Madison’s,\nand I had, I suppose, got half-way down, where a black craggy cliff juts\ninto the ravine on the right, when I halted to have a pull at my\nflask. I had my eye fixed at the time upon the projecting cliff I have\nmentioned, and noticed nothing unusual about it. I then put up my flask\nand took a step or two forward, when in a moment there burst, apparently\nfrom the base of the rock, about eight feet from the ground and\na hundred yards from me, a strange, lurid glare, flickering and\noscillating, gradually dying away and then reappearing again. No, no;\nI’ve seen many a glow-worm and firefly--nothing of that sort. There it\nwas, burning away, and I suppose I gazed at it, trembling in every limb,\nfor fully ten minutes. Then I took a step forward, when instantly it\nvanished, vanished like a candle blown out. I stepped back again; but it\nwas some time before I could find the exact spot and position from\nwhich it was visible. At last, there it was, the weird reddish light,\nflickering away as before. Then I screwed up my courage, and made for\nthe rock; but the ground was so uneven that it was impossible to steer\nstraight; and though I walked along the whole base of the cliff, I could\nsee nothing. Then I made tracks for home; and I can tell you, boys,\nthat, until you remarked it, I never knew it was raining, the whole way\nalong. But hollo! what’s the matter with Tom?”\n\nWhat indeed? Tom was now sitting with his legs over the side of the\nbunk, and his whole face betraying excitement so intense as to be almost\npainful. “The fiend would have two eyes. How many lights did you see,\nDick? Speak out!”\n\n“Only one.”\n\n“Hurrah!” cried Tom, “that’s better.” Whereupon he kicked the blankets\ninto the middle of the room, and began pacing up and down with long\nfeverish strides. Suddenly he stopped opposite Dick, and laid his hand\nupon his shoulder. “I say, Dick, could we get to Sasassa Valley before\nsunrise?”\n\n“Scarcely,” said Dick.\n\n“Well, look here; we are old friends, Dick Wharton, you and I. Now don’t\nyou tell any other man what you have told us, for a week. You’ll promise\nthat, won’t you?”\n\nI could see by the look on Dick’s face as he acquiesced that he\nconsidered poor Tom to be mad; and indeed I was myself completely\nmystified by his conduct. I had, however, seen so many proofs of my\nfriend’s good sense and quickness of apprehension that I thought it\nquite possible that Wharton’s story had had a meaning in his eyes which\nI was too obtuse to take in.\n\nAll night Tom Donahue was greatly excited, and when Wharton left\nhe begged him to remember his promise, and also elicited from him a\ndescription of the exact spot at which he had seen the apparition, as\nwell as the hour at which it appeared. After his departure, which must\nhave been about four in the morning, I turned into my bunk and watched\nTom sitting by the fire splicing two sticks together, until I fell\nasleep. I suppose I must have slept about two hours; but when I awoke\nTom was still sitting working away in almost the same position. He had\nfixed the one stick across the top of the other so as to form a rough T,\nand was now busy in fitting a smaller stick into the angle between\nthem, by manipulating which, the cross one could be either cocked up or\ndepressed to any extent. He had cut notches, too, in the perpendicular\nstick, so that, by the aid of the small prop, the cross one could be\nkept in any position for an indefinite time.\n\n“Look here, Jack!” he cried, when he saw that I was awake. “Come and\ngive me your opinion. Suppose I put this cross-stick pointing straight\nat a thing, and arranged this small one so as to keep it so, and left\nit, I could find that thing again if I wanted it--don’t you think I\ncould, Jack--don’t you think so?” he continued, nervously, clutching me\nby the arm.\n\n“Well,” I answered, “it would depend on how far off the thing was, and\nhow accurately it was pointed. If it were any distance, I’d cut sights\non your cross-stick; then a string tied to the end of it, and held in\na plumb-line forward, would lend you pretty near what you wanted. But\nsurely, Tom, you don’t intend to localise the ghost in that way?”\n\n“You’ll see to-night, old friend--you’ll see to-night. I’ll carry this\nto the Sasassa Valley. You get the loan of Madison’s crowbar, and come\nwith me; but mind you tell no man where you are going, or what you want\nit for.”\n\nAll day Tom was walking up and down the room, or working hard at the\napparatus. His eyes were glistening, his cheeks hectic, and he had all\nthe symptoms of high fever. “Heaven grant that Dick’s diagnosis be not\ncorrect!” I thought, as I returned with the crowbar; and yet, as evening\ndrew near, I found myself imperceptibly sharing the excitement.\n\nAbout six o’clock Tom sprang to his feet and seized his sticks. “I can\nstand it no longer, Jack,” he cried; “up with your crowbar, and hey for\nSasassa Valley! To-night’s work, my lad, will either make us or mar us!\nTake your six-shooter, in case we meet the Kaffirs. I daren’t take mine,\nJack,” he continued, putting his hands upon my shoulders--“I daren’t\ntake mine; for if my ill luck sticks to me to-night, I don’t know what I\nmight not do with it.”\n\nWell, having filled our pockets with provisions, we set out, and, as we\ntook our wearisome way toward the Sasassa Valley, I frequently attempted\nto elicit from my companion some clue as to his intentions. But his only\nanswer was: “Let us hurry on, Jack. Who knows how many have heard of\nWharton’s adventure by this time! Let us hurry on, or we may not be\nfirst in the field!”\n\nWell, sir, we struggled on through the hills for a matter of ten miles;\ntill at last, after descending a crag, we saw opening out in front of\nus a ravine so sombre and dark that it might have been the gate of\nHades itself; cliffs many hundred feet shut in on every side the gloomy\nboulder-studded passage which led through the haunted defile into\nKaffirland. The moon, rising above the crags, threw into strong relief\nthe rough, irregular pinnacles of rock by which they were topped, while\nall below was dark as Erebus.\n\n“The Sasassa Valley?” said I.\n\n“Yes,” said Tom.\n\nI looked at him. He was calm now; the flush and feverishness had passed\naway; his actions were deliberate and slow. Yet there was a certain\nrigidity in his face and glitter in his eye which showed that a crisis\nhad come.\n\nWe entered the pass, stumbling along amid the great boulders. Suddenly I\nheard a short, quick exclamation from Tom. “That’s the crag!” he cried,\npointing to a great mass looming before us in the darkness. “Now, Jack,\nfor any favour use your eyes! We’re about a hundred yards from that\ncliff, I take it; so you move slowly toward one side and I’ll do the\nsame toward the other. When you see anything, stop and call out. Don’t\ntake more than twelve inches in a step, and keep your eye fixed on the\ncliff about eight feet from the ground. Are you ready?”\n\n“Yes.” I was even more excited than Tom by this time. What his intention\nor object was I could not conjecture, beyond that he wanted to examine\nby daylight the part of the cliff from which the light came. Yet the\ninfluence of the romantic situation and my companion’s suppressed\nexcitement was so great that I could feel the blood coursing through my\nveins and count the pulses throbbing at my temples.\n\n“Start!” cried Tom; and we moved off, he to the right, I to the left,\neach with our eyes fixed intently on the base of the crag. I had moved\nperhaps twenty feet, when in a moment it burst upon me. Through the\ngrowing darkness there shone a small, ruddy, glowing point, the light\nfrom which waned and increased, flickered and oscillated, each change\nproducing a more weird effect than the last. The old Kaffir superstition\ncame into my mind, and I felt a cold shudder pass over me. In my\nexcitement I stepped a pace backward, when instantly the light went out,\nleaving utter darkness in its place; but when I advanced again, there\nwas the ruddy glare glowing from the base of the cliff. “Tom, Tom!” I\ncried.\n\n“Ay, ay!” I heard him exclaim, as he hurried over toward me.\n\n“There it is--there, up against the cliff!”\n\nTom was at my elbow. “I see nothing,” said he.\n\n“Why, there, there, man, in front of you!” I stepped to the right as I\nspoke, when the light instantly vanished from my eyes.\n\nBut from Tom’s ejaculations of delight it was clear that from my former\nposition it was visible to him also. “Jack,” he cried, as he turned and\nwrung my hand--“Jack, you and I can never complain of our luck again.\nNow heap up a few stones where we are standing. That’s right. Now we\nmust fix my sign-post firmly in at the top. There! It would take a\nstrong wind to blow that down; and we only need it to hold out till\nmorning. O Jack, my boy, to think that only yesterday we were talking of\nbecoming clerks, and you saying that no man knew what was awaiting him,\ntoo! By Jove, Jack, it would make a good story!”\n\nBy this time we had firmly fixed the perpendicular stick in between the\ntwo large stones; and Tom bent down and peered along the horizontal one.\nFor fully a quarter of an hour he was alternately raising and depressing\nit, until at last, with a sigh of satisfaction, he fixed the prop into\nthe angle, and stood up. “Look along, Jack,” he said. “You have as\nstraight an eye to take a sight as any man I know of.”\n\nI looked along. There beyond the farther sight was the ruddy,\nscintillating speck, apparently at the end of the stick itself, so\naccurately had it been adjusted.\n\n“And now, my boy,” said Tom, “let’s have some supper and a sleep.\nThere’s nothing more to be done to-night; but we’ll need all our wits\nand strength to-morrow. Get some sticks and kindle a fire here, and then\nwe’ll be able to keep an eye on our signal-post, and see that nothing\nhappens to it during the night.”\n\nWell, sir, we kindled a fire, and had supper with the Sasassa demon’s\neye rolling and glowing in front of us the whole night through. Not\nalways in the same place, though; for after supper, when I glanced along\nthe sights to have another look at it, it was nowhere to be seen. The\ninformation did not, however, seem to disturb Tom in any way. He merely\nremarked, “It’s the moon, not the thing, that has shifted;” and coiling\nhimself up, went to sleep.\n\nBy early dawn we were both up, and gazing along our pointer at the\ncliff; but we could make out nothing save the one dead, monotonous,\nslaty surface, rougher perhaps at the part we were examining than\nelsewhere, but otherwise presenting nothing remarkable.\n\n“Now for your idea, Jack!” said Tom Donahue, unwinding a long thin cord\nfrom round his waist. “You fasten it, and guide me while I take the\nother end.” So saying, he walked off to the base of the cliff, holding\none end of the cord, while I drew the other taut, and wound it round the\nmiddle of the horizontal stick, passing it through the sight at the end.\nBy this means I could direct Tom to the right or left, until we had our\nstring stretching from the point of attachment, through the sight, and\non to the rock, which it struck about eight feet from the ground. Tom\ndrew a chalk circle of about three feet diameter round the spot, and\nthen called to me to come and join him. “We’ve managed this business\ntogether, Jack,” he said, “and we’ll find what we are to find,\ntogether.” The circle he had drawn embraced a part of the rock smoother\nthan the rest, save that about the centre there were a few rough\nprotuberances or knobs. One of these Tom pointed to with a cry of\ndelight. It was a roughish, brownish mass about the size of a man’s\nclosed fist, and looking like a bit of dirty glass let into the wall of\nthe cliff. “That’s it!” he cried--“that’s it!”\n\n“That’s what?”\n\n“Why, man, _a diamond_, and such a one as there isn’t a monarch in\nEurope but would envy Tom Donahue the possession of. Up with your\ncrowbar, and we’ll soon exorcise the demon of Sasassa Valley!”\n\nI was so astounded that for a moment I stood speechless with surprise,\ngazing at the treasure which had so unexpectedly fallen into our hands.\n\n“Here, hand me the crowbar,” said Tom. “Now, by using this little round\nknob which projects from the cliff here as a fulcrum, we may be able to\nlever it off. Yes; there it goes. I never thought it could have come so\neasily. Now, Jack, the sooner we get back to our hut and then down to\nCape Town, the better.”\n\nWe wrapped up our treasure, and made our way across the hills toward\nhome. On the way, Tom told me how, while a law student in the Middle\nTemple, he had come upon a dusty pamphlet in the library, by one Jans\nvan Hounym, which told of an experience very similar to ours, which\nhad befallen that worthy Dutchman in the latter part of the seventeenth\ncentury, and which resulted in the discovery of a luminous diamond. This\ntale it was which had come into Tom’s head as he listened to honest Dick\nWharton’s ghost-story, while the means which he had adopted to verify\nhis supposition sprang from his own fertile Irish brain.\n\n“We’ll take it down to Cape Town,” continued Tom, “and if we can’t\ndispose of it with advantage there, it will be worth our while to ship\nfor London with it. Let us go along to Madison’s first, though; he knows\nsomething of these things, and can perhaps give us some idea of what we\nmay consider a fair price for our treasure.”\n\nWe turned off from the track accordingly, before reaching our hut, and\nkept along the narrow path leading to Madison’s farm. He was at lunch\nwhen we entered; and in a minute we were seated at each side of him,\nenjoying South African hospitality.\n\n“Well,” he said, after the servants were gone, “what’s in the wind now?\nI see you have something to say to me. What is it?”\n\nTom produced his packet, and solemnly untied the handkerchiefs which\nenveloped it. “There!” he said, putting his crystal on the table; “what\nwould you say was a fair price for that?”\n\nMadison took it up and examined it critically. “Well,” he said, laying\nit down again, “in its crude state about twelve shillings per ton.”\n\n“Twelve shillings!” cried Tom, starting to his feet. “Don’t you see what\nit is?”\n\n“Rock-salt!”\n\n“Rock-salt be d--d! a diamond.”\n\n“Taste it!” said Madison.\n\nTom put it to his lips, dashed it down with a dreadful exclamation, and\nrushed out of the room.\n\nI felt sad and disappointed enough myself; but presently, remembering\nwhat Tom had said about the pistol, I, too left the house, and made for\nthe hut, leaving Madison open-mouthed with astonishment. When I got in,\nI found Tom lying in his bunk with his face to the wall, too dispirited\napparently to answer my consolations. Anathematising Dick and Madison,\nthe Sasassa demon, and everything else, I strolled out of the hut, and\nrefreshed myself with a pipe after our wearisome adventure. I was about\nfifty yards from the hut, when I heard issuing from it the sound which\nof all others I least expected to hear. Had it been a groan or an oath,\nI should have taken it as a matter of course; but the sound which\ncaused me to stop and take the pipe out of my mouth was a hearty roar of\nlaughter! Next moment Tom himself emerged from the door, his whole face\nradiant with delight. “Game for another ten-mile walk, old fellow?”\n\n“What! for another lump of rock-salt, at twelve shillings a ton?”\n\n“‘No more of that, Hal, an you love me,’ “ grinned Tom. “Now look here,\nJack. What blessed fools we are to be so floored by a trifle! Just sit\non this stump for five minutes, and I’ll make it as clear as daylight.\nYou’ve seen many a lump of rock-salt stuck in a crag, and so have I,\nthough we did make such a mull of this one. Now, Jack, did any of\nthe pieces you have ever seen shine in the darkness brighter than any\nfire-fly?”\n\n“Well, I can’t say they ever did.”\n\n“I’d venture to prophesy that if we waited until night, which we won’t\ndo, we would see that light still glimmering among the rocks. Therefore,\nJack, when we took away this worthless salt, we took the wrong crystal.\nIt is no very strange thing in these hills that a piece of rock-salt\nshould be lying within a foot of a diamond. It caught our eyes, and\nwe were excited, and so we made fools of ourselves, and _left the real\nstone behind_. Depend upon it, Jack, the Sasassa gem is lying within\nthat magic circle of chalk upon the face of yonder cliff. Come, old\nfellow, light your pipe and stow your revolver, and we’ll be off before\nthat fellow Madison has time to put two and two together.”\n\nI don’t know that I was very sanguine this time. I had begun, in fact,\nto look upon the diamond as a most unmitigated nuisance. However, rather\nthan throw a damper on Tom’s expectations, I announced myself eager to\nstart. What a walk it was! Tom was always a good mountaineer, but his\nexcitement seemed to lend him wings that day, while I scrambled along\nafter him as best I could.\n\nWhen we got within half a mile he broke into the “double,” and never\npulled up until he reached the round white circle upon the cliff. Poor\nold Tom! when I came up, his mood had changed, and he was standing\nwith his hands in his pockets, gazing vacantly before him with a rueful\ncountenance.\n\n“Look!” he said, “look!” and he pointed at the cliff. Not a sign of\nanything in the least resembling a diamond there. The circle included\nnothing but a flat slate-coloured stone, with one large hole, where we\nhad extracted the rock-salt, and one or two smaller depressions. No sign\nof the gem.\n\n“I’ve been over every inch of it,” said poor Tom. “It’s not there. Some\none has been here and noticed the chalk, and taken it. Come home, Jack;\nI feel sick and tired. Oh, had any man ever luck like mine!”\n\nI turned to go, but took one last look at the cliff first. Tom was\nalready ten paces off.\n\n“Hollo!” I cried, “don’t you see any change in that circle since\nyesterday?”\n\n“What d’ ye mean?” said Tom.\n\n“Don’t you miss a thing that was there before?”\n\n“The rock-salt?” said Tom.\n\n“No; but the little round knob that we used for a fulcrum. I suppose we\nmust have wrenched it off in using the lever. Let’s have a look at what\nit’s made of.”\n\nAccordingly, at the foot of the cliff we searched about among the loose\nstones.\n\n“Here you are, Jack! We’ve done it at last! We’re made men!”\n\nI turned round, and there was Tom radiant with delight, and with the\nlittle corner of black rock in his hand. At first sight it seemed to\nbe merely a chip from the cliff; but near the base there was projecting\nfrom it an object which Tom was now exultingly pointing out. It\nlooked at first something like a glass eye; but there was a depth and\nbrilliancy about it such as glass never exhibited. There was no mistake\nthis time; we had certainly got possession of a jewel of great value;\nand with light hearts we turned from the valley, bearing away with us\nthe “fiend” which had so long reigned there.\n\nThere, sir; I’ve spun my story out too long, and tired you perhaps.\nYou see, when I get talking of those rough old days, I kind of see the\nlittle cabin again, and the brook beside it, and the bush around, and\nseem to hear Tom’s honest voice once more. There’s little for me to say\nnow. We prospered on the gem. Tom Donahue, as you know, has set up\nhere, and is well known about town. I have done well, farming and\nostrich-raising in Africa. We set old Dick Wharton up in business, and\nhe is one of our nearest neighbours. If you should ever be coming up our\nway, sir, you’ll not forget to ask for Jack Turnbull--Jack Turnbull of\nSasassa Farm.'),(6,'LONG ODDS, By H. Rider Haggard\n\n\nThe story which is narrated in the following pages came to me from the\nlips of my old friend Allan Quatermain, or Hunter Quatermain, as we used\nto call him in South Africa. He told it to me one evening when I was\nstopping with him at the place he bought in Yorkshire. Shortly after\nthat, the death of his only son so unsettled him that he immediately\nleft England, accompanied by two companions, his old fellow-voyagers,\nSir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and has now utterly vanished into the\ndark heart of Africa. He is persuaded that a white people, of which he\nhas heard rumours all his life, exists somewhere on the highlands in the\nvast, still unexplored interior, and his great ambition is to find them\nbefore he dies. This is the wild quest upon which he and his companions\nhave departed, and from which I shrewdly suspect they never will return.\nOne letter only have I received from the old gentleman, dated from a\nmission station high up the Tana, a river on the east coast, about\nthree hundred miles north of Zanzibar; in it he says that they have gone\nthrough many hardships and adventures, but are alive and well, and have\nfound traces which go far toward making him hope that the results of\ntheir wild quest may be a “magnificent and unexampled discovery.” I\ngreatly fear, however, that all he has discovered is death; for this\nletter came a long while ago, and nobody has heard a single word of the\nparty since. They have totally vanished.\n\nIt was on the last evening of my stay at his house that he told the\nensuing story to me and Captain Good, who was dining with him. He had\neaten his dinner and drunk two or three glasses of old port, just to\nhelp Good and myself to the end of the second bottle. It was an unusual\nthing for him to do, for he was a most abstemious man, having conceived,\nas he used to say, a great horror of drink from observing its\neffects upon the class of colonists--hunters, transport-riders\nand others--amongst whom he had passed so many years of his life.\nConsequently the good wine took more effect on him than it would have\ndone on most men, sending a little flush into his wrinkled cheeks, and\nmaking him talk more freely than usual.\n\nDear old man! I can see him now, as he went limping up and down the\nvestibule, with his gray hair sticking up in scrubbing-brush fashion,\nhis shrivelled yellow face, and his large dark eyes, that were as keen\nas any hawk’s, and yet soft as a buck’s. The whole room was hung with\ntrophies of his numerous hunting expeditions, and he had some story\nabout every one of them, if only he could be got to tell it. Generally\nhe would not, for he was not very fond of narrating his own adventures,\nbut to-night the port wine made him more communicative.\n\n“Ah, you brute!” he said, stopping beneath an unusually large skull of\na lion, which was fixed just over the mantelpiece, beneath a long row of\nguns, its jaws distended to their utmost width. “Ah, you brute! you have\ngiven me a lot of trouble for the last dozen years, and will, I suppose\nto my dying day.”\n\n“Tell us the yarn, Quatermain,” said Good. “You have often promised to\ntell me, and you never have.”\n\n“You had better not ask me to,” he answered, “for it is a longish one.”\n\n“All right,” I said, “the evening is young, and there is some more\nport.”\n\nThus adjured, he filled his pipe from a jar of coarse-cut Boer tobacco\nthat was always standing on the mantelpiece, and still walking up and\ndown the room, began:\n\n“It was, I think, in the March of ‘69 that I was up in Sikukuni’s\ncountry. It was just after old Sequati’s time, and Sikukuni had got into\npower--I forget how. Anyway, I was there. I had heard that the Bapedi\npeople had brought down an enormous quantity of ivory from the interior,\nand so I started with a waggon-load of goods, and came straight away\nfrom Middelburg to try and trade some of it. It was a risky thing to\ngo into the country so early, on account of the fever; but I knew that\nthere were one or two others after that lot of ivory, so I determined\nto have a try for it, and take my chance of fever. I had become so tough\nfrom continual knocking about that I did not set it down at much. Well,\nI got on all right for a while. It is a wonderfully beautiful piece of\nbush veldt, with great ranges of mountains running through it, and round\ngranite koppies starting up here and there, looking out like sentinels\nover the rolling waste of bush. But it is very hot,--hot as a\nstew-pan,--and when I was there that March, which, of course, is autumn\nin this part of Africa, the whole place reeked of fever. Every morning,\nas I trekked along down by the Oliphant River, I used to creep from the\nwaggon at dawn and look out. But there was no river to be seen--only a\nlong line of billows of what looked like the finest cotton-wool tossed\nup lightly with a pitchfork. It was the fever mist. Out from among the\nscrub, too, came little spirals of vapour, as though there were hundreds\nof tiny fires alight in it--reek rising from thousands of tons of\nrotting vegetation. It was a beautiful place, but the beauty was the\nbeauty of death; and all those lines and blots of vapour wrote one great\nword across the surface of the country, and that word was ‘fever.’\n\n“It was a dreadful year of illness that. I came, I remember, to one\nlittle kraal of knobnoses, and went up to it to see if I could get some\n_maas_ (curdled butter-milk) and a few mealies. As I got near I was\nstruck with the silence of the place. No children began to chatter, and\nno dogs barked. Nor could I see any native sheep or cattle. The place,\nthough it had evidently been recently inhabited, was as still as the\nbush round it, and some guinea-fowl got up out of the prickly pear\nbushes right at the kraal gate. I remember that I hesitated a little\nbefore going in, there was such an air of desolation about the spot.\nNature never looks desolate when man has not yet laid his hand upon her\nbreast; she is only lovely. But when man has been, and has passed away,\nthen she looks desolate.\n\n“Well, I passed into the kraal, and went up to the principal hut. In\nfront of the hut was something with an old sheepskin _kaross_ (rug)\nthrown over it. I stooped down and drew off the rug, and then shrank\nback amazed, for under it was the body of a young woman recently dead.\nFor a moment I thought of turning back, but my curiosity overcame me; so\ngoing past the dead woman, I went down on my hands and knees and crept\ninto the hut. It was so dark that I could not see anything, though\nI could smell a great deal, so I lit a match. It was a ‘tandstickor’\nmatch, and burnt slowly and dimly, and as the light gradually increased\nI made out what I took to be a family of people, men, women, and\nchildren, fast asleep. Presently it burnt up brightly, and I saw that\nthey too, five of them altogether, were quite dead. One was a baby. I\ndropped the match in a hurry, and was making my way out of the hut as\nhard as I could go, when I caught sight of two bright eyes staring\nout of a corner. Thinking it was a wild cat, or some such animal, I\nredoubled my haste, when suddenly a voice near the eyes began first to\nmutter, and then to send up a succession of awful yells. Hastily I lit\nanother match, and perceived that the eyes belonged to an old woman,\nwrapped up in a greasy leather garment. Taking her by the arm, I dragged\nher out, for she could not, or would not, come by herself, and the\nstench was overpowering me. Such a sight as she was--a bag of bones,\ncovered over with black, shrivelled parchment. The only white thing\nabout her was her wool, and she seemed to be pretty well dead except for\nher eyes and her voice. She thought that I was a devil come to take her,\nand that is why she yelled so. Well, I got her down to the waggon,\nand gave her a ‘tot’ of Cape smoke, and then, as soon as it was ready,\npoured about a pint of beef-tea down her throat, made from the flesh\nof a blue vilder-beeste I had killed the day before, and after that she\nbrightened up wonderfully. She could talk Zulu,--indeed, it turned out\nthat she had run away from Zululand in T’Chaka’s time,--and she told\nme that all the people whom I had seen had died of fever. When they had\ndied the other inhabitants of the kraal had taken the cattle and\ngone away, leaving the poor old woman, who was helpless from age and\ninfirmity, to perish of starvation or disease, as the case might be. She\nhad been sitting there for three days among the bodies when I found her.\nI took her on to the next kraal, and gave the headman a blanket to look\nafter her, promising him another if I found her well when I came back. I\nremember that he was much astonished at my parting with two blankets for\nthe sake of such a worthless old creature. ‘Why did I not leave her in\nthe bush?’ he asked. Those people carry the doctrine of the survival of\nthe fittest to its extreme, you see.\n\n“It was the night after I had got rid of the old woman that I made my\nfirst acquaintance with my friend yonder,” and he nodded toward the\nskull that seemed to be grinning down at us in the shadow of the wide\nmantel-shelf. “I had trekked from dawn till eleven o’clock,--a long\ntrek,--but I wanted to get on; and then had turned the oxen out to\ngraze, sending the voorlooper to look after them, meaning to inspan\nagain about six o’clock, and trek with the moon till ten. Then I got\ninto the waggon and had a good sleep till half-past two or so in the\nafternoon, when I rose and cooked some meat, and had my dinner, washing\nit down with a pannikin of black coffee; for it was difficult to get\npreserved milk in those days. Just as I had finished, and the driver, a\nman called Tom, was washing up the things, in comes the young scoundrel\nof a voorlooper driving one ox before him.\n\n“‘Where are the other oxen?’ I asked.\n\n“‘Koos!’ he said, ‘Koos! (chief) the other oxen have gone away. I turned\nmy back for a minute, and when I looked round again they were all gone\nexcept Kaptein, here, who was rubbing his back against a tree.’\n\n“‘You mean that you have been asleep, and let them stray, you villain. I\nwill rub your back against a stick,’ I answered, feeling very angry, for\nit was not a pleasant prospect to be stuck up in that fever-trap for a\nweek or so while we were hunting for the oxen. ‘Off you go, and you too,\nTom, and mind you don’t come back till you have found them. They have\ntrekked back along the Middelburg Road, and are a dozen miles off by\nnow, I’ll be bound. Now, no words; go, both of you.’\n\n“Tom, the driver, swore and caught the lad a hearty kick, which he\nrichly deserved, and then, having tied old Kaptein up to the disselboom\nwith a riem, they took their assegais and sticks, and started. I would\nhave gone too, only I knew that somebody must look after the waggon, and\nI did not like to leave either of the boys with it at night. I was in a\nvery bad temper, indeed, although I was pretty well used to these sort\nof occurrences, and soothed myself by taking a rifle and going to kill\nsomething. For a couple of hours I poked about without seeing anything\nthat I could get a shot at, but at last, just as I was again within\nseventy yards of the waggon, I put up an old Impala ram from behind a\nmimosa-thorn. He ran straight for the waggon, and it was not till he was\npassing within a few feet of it that I could get a decent shot at him.\nThen I pulled, and caught him half-way down the spine; over he went,\ndead as a door-nail, and a pretty shot it was, though I ought not to say\nit. This little incident put me into rather a better temper, especially\nas the buck had rolled right against the after part of the waggon, so I\nhad only to gut him, fix a riem round his legs, and haul him up. By the\ntime I had done this the sun was down, and the full moon was up, and\na beautiful moon it was. And then there came that wonderful hush which\nsometimes falls over the African bush in the early hours of the night.\nNo beast was moving, and no bird called. Not a breath of air stirred the\nquiet trees, and the shadows did not even quiver, they only grew. It was\nvery oppressive and very lonely, for there was not a sign of the cattle\nor the boys. I was quite thankful for the society of old Kaptein, who\nwas lying down contentedly against the disselboom, chewing the cud with\na good conscience.\n\n“Presently, however, Kaptein began to get restless. First he snorted,\nthen he got up and snorted again. I could not make it out, so like a\nfool I got down off the waggon-box to have a look round, thinking it\nmight be the lost oxen coming.\n\n“Next instant I regretted it, for all of a sudden I heard a roar and saw\nsomething yellow flash past me and light on poor Kaptein. Then came\na bellow of agony from the ox, and a crunch as the lion put his teeth\nthrough the poor brute’s neck, and I began to understand what had\nhappened. My rifle was in the waggon, and my first thought was to get\nhold of it, and I turned and made a bolt for it. I got my foot on the\nwheel and flung my body forward on to the waggon, and there I stopped as\nif I were frozen, and no wonder, for as I was about to spring up I heard\nthe lion behind me, and next second I felt the brute, ay, as plainly as\nI can feel this table. I felt him, I say, sniffing at my left leg that\nwas hanging down.\n\n“My word! I did feel queer; I don’t think that I ever felt so queer\nbefore. I dared not move for the life of me, and the odd thing was that\nI seemed to lose power over my leg, which developed an insane sort\nof inclination to kick out of its own mere motion--just as hysterical\npeople want to laugh when they ought to be particularly solemn. Well,\nthe lion sniffed and sniffed, beginning at my ankle and slowly nosing\naway up to my thigh. I thought that he was going to get hold then, but\nhe did not. He only growled softly, and went back to the ox. Shifting my\nhead a little I got a full view of him. He was about the biggest lion\nI ever saw,--and I have seen a great many, and he had a most tremendous\nblack mane. What his teeth were like you can see--look there, pretty big\nones, ain’t they? Altogether he was a magnificent animal, and as I lay\nsprawling on the fore tongue of the waggon, it occurred to me that he\nwould look uncommonly well in a cage. He stood there by the carcass of\npoor Kaptein, and deliberately disembowelled him as neatly as a butcher\ncould have done. All this while I dared not move, for he kept lifting\nhis head and keeping an eye on me as he licked his bloody chops. When\nhe had cleaned Kaptein out he opened his mouth and roared, and I am not\nexaggerating when I say that the sound shook the waggon. Instantly there\ncame back an answering roar.\n\n“‘Heavens!’ I thought, ‘there is his mate.’\n\n“Hardly was the thought out of my head when I caught sight in the\nmoonlight of the lioness bounding along through the long grass, and\nafter her a couple of cubs about the size of mastiffs. She stopped\nwithin a few feet of my head, and stood, and waved her tail, and fixed\nme with her glowing yellow eyes; but just as I thought that it was all\nover she turned and began to feed on Kaptein, and so did the cubs. There\nwere the four of them within eight feet of me, growling and quarrelling,\nrending and tearing, and crunching poor Kaptein’s bones; and there I\nlay shaking with terror, and the cold perspiration pouring out of me,\nfeeling like another Daniel come to judgment in a new sense of the\nphrase. Presently the cubs had eaten their fill, and began to get\nrestless. One went round to the back of the waggon and pulled at\nthe Impala buck that hung there, and the other came round my way and\ncommenced the sniffing game at my leg. Indeed, he did more than that,\nfor, my trouser being hitched up a little, he began to lick the bare\nskin with his rough tongue. The more he licked the more he liked it, to\njudge from his increased vigour and the loud purring noise he made. Then\nI knew that the end had come, for in another second his file-like tongue\nwould have rasped through the skin of my leg--which was luckily pretty\ntough--and have drawn the blood, and then there would be no chance\nfor me. So I just lay there and thought of my sins, and prayed to the\nAlmighty, and thought that, after all, life was a very enjoyable thing.\n\n“And then all of a sudden I heard a crashing of bushes and the shouting\nand whistling of men, and there were the two boys coming back with the\ncattle, which they had found trekking along all together. The lions\nlifted their heads and listened, then without a sound bounded off--and I\nfainted.\n\n“The lions came back no more that night, and by the next morning my\nnerves had got pretty straight again; but I was full of wrath when I\nthought of all that I had gone through at the hands, or rather noses,\nof those four lions, and of the fate of my after-ox Kaptein. He was a\nsplendid ox, and I was very fond of him. So wroth was I that, like a\nfool, I determined to attack the whole family of them. It was worthy of\na greenhorn out on his first hunting-trip; but I did it nevertheless.\nAccordingly after breakfast, having rubbed some oil upon my leg, which\nwas very sore from the cub’s tongue, I took the driver, Tom, who did not\nhalf like the job, and having armed myself with an ordinary double No.\n12 smooth-bore, the first breech-loader I ever had, I started. I took\nthe smooth-bore because it shot a bullet very well; and my experience\nhas been that a round ball from a smooth-bore is quite as effective\nagainst a lion as an express bullet. The lion is soft, and not a\ndifficult animal to finish if you hit him anywhere in the body. A buck\ntakes far more killing.\n\n“Well, I started, and the first thing I set to work to do was to try to\nmake out whereabouts the brutes lay up for the day. About three hundred\nyards from the waggon was the crest of a rise covered with single\nmimosa-trees, dotted about in a park-like fashion, and beyond this was\na stretch of open plain running down to a dry pan, or water-hole, which\ncovered about an acre of ground, and was densely clothed with reeds,\nnow in the sear and yellow leaf. From the farther edge of this pan the\nground sloped up again to a great cleft, or nullah, which had been cut\nout by the action of the water, and was pretty thickly sprinkled with\nbush, among which grew some large trees, I forget of what sort.\n\n“It at once struck me that the dry pan would be a likely place to find\nmy friends in, as there is nothing a lion is fonder of than lying up\nin reeds, through which he can see things without being seen himself.\nAccordingly thither I went and prospected. Before I had got half-way\nround the pan I found the remains of a blue vilder-beeste that had\nevidently been killed within the last three or four days and partially\ndevoured by lions; and from other indications about I was soon assured\nthat if the family were not in the pan that day they spent a good deal\nof their spare time there. But if there, the question was how to get\nthem out; for it was clearly impossible to think of going in after\nthem unless one was quite determined to commit suicide. Now there was a\nstrong wind blowing from the direction of the waggon, across the reedy\npan toward the bush-clad kloof or donga, and this first gave me the\nidea of firing the reeds, which, as I think I told you, were pretty dry.\nAccordingly Tom took some matches and began starting little fires to the\nleft, and I did the same to the right. But the reeds were still green\nat the bottom, and we should never have got them well alight had it not\nbeen for the wind, which grew stronger and stronger as the sun climbed\nhigher, and forced the fire into them. At last, after half an hour’s\ntrouble, the flames got a hold, and began to spread out like a fan,\nwhereupon I went round to the farther side of the pan to wait for the\nlions, standing well out in the open, as we stood at the copse to-day\nwhere you shot the woodcock. It was a rather risky thing to do, but I\nused to be so sure of my shooting in those days that I did not so much\nmind the risk. Scarcely had I got round when I heard the reeds parting\nbefore the onward rush of some animal. ‘Now for it,’ said I. On it came.\nI could see that it was yellow, and prepared for action, when instead\nof a lion out bounded a beautiful rietbok which had been lying in\nthe shelter of the pan. It must, by the way, have been a rietbok of a\npeculiarly confiding nature to lay itself down with the lion, like the\nlamb of prophecy, but I suppose the reeds were thick, and that it kept a\nlong way off.\n\n“Well, I let the rietbok go, and it went like the wind, and kept my\neyes fixed upon the reeds. The fire was burning like a furnace now; the\nflames crackling and roaring as they bit into the reeds, sending spouts\nof fire twenty feet and more into the air, and making the hot air dance\nabove it in a way that was perfectly dazzling. But the reeds were\nstill half green, and created an enormous quantity of smoke, which came\nrolling toward me like a curtain, lying very low on account of the wind.\nPresently, above the crackling of the fire, I heard a startled roar,\nthen another and another. So the lions were at home.\n\n“I was beginning to get excited now, for, as you fellows know, there\nis nothing in experience to warm up your nerves like a lion at close\nquarters, unless it is a wounded buffalo; and I got still more so when\nI made out through the smoke that the lions were all moving about on the\nextreme edge of the reeds. Occasionally they would pop their heads out\nlike rabbits from a burrow, and then, catching sight of me standing\nabout fifty yards out, draw them back again. I knew that it must be\ngetting pretty warm behind them, and that they could not keep the game\nup for long; and I was not mistaken, for suddenly all four of them broke\ncover together, the old black-maned lion leading by a few yards. I never\nsaw a more splendid sight in all my hunting experience than those four\nlions bounding across the veldt, overshadowed by the dense pall of smoke\nand backed by the fiery furnace of the burning reeds.\n\n“I reckoned that they would pass, on their road to the bushy kloof,\nwithin about five and twenty yards of me; so, taking a long breath, I\ngot my gun well on to the lion’s shoulder--the black-maned one--so as to\nallow for an inch or two of motion, and catch him through the heart.\nI was on, dead on, and my finger was just beginning to tighten on the\ntrigger, when suddenly I went blind--a bit of reed-ash had drifted into\nmy right eye. I danced and rubbed, and succeeded in clearing it more or\nless just in time to see the tail of the last lion vanishing round the\nbushes up the kloof.\n\n“If ever a man was mad I was that man. It was too bad; and such a shot\nin the open, too! However, I was not going to be beaten, so I just\nturned and marched for the kloof. Tom, the driver, begged and implored\nme not to go; but though as a general rule I never pretend to be very\nbrave (which I am not), I was determined that I would either kill those\nlions or they should kill me. So I told Tom that he need not come unless\nhe liked, but I was going; and being a plucky fellow, a Swazi by birth,\nhe shrugged his shoulders, muttered that I was mad or bewitched, and\nfollowed doggedly in my tracks.\n\n“We soon got to the kloof, which was about three hundred yards in length\nand but sparsely wooded, and then the real fun began. There might be a\nlion behind every bush--there certainly were four lions somewhere; the\ndelicate question was, where. I peeped and poked and looked in every\npossible direction, with my heart in my mouth, and was at last rewarded\nby catching a glimpse of something yellow moving behind a bush. At the\nsame moment, from another bush opposite me out burst one of the cubs and\ngalloped back toward the burned-out pan. I whipped round and let drive a\nsnap-shot that tipped him head over heels, breaking his back within two\ninches of the root of the tail, and there he lay helpless but glaring.\nTom afterward killed him with his assegai. I opened the breech of the\ngun and hurriedly pulled out the old case, which, to judge from what\nensued, must, I suppose, have burst and left a portion of its fabric\nsticking to the barrel. At any rate, when I tried to get in the new case\nit would only enter half-way; and--would you believe it?--this was the\nmoment that the lioness, attracted no doubt by the outcry of her cub,\nchose to put in an appearance. There she stood, twenty paces or so from\nme, lashing her tail and looking just as wicked as it is possible to\nconceive. Slowly I stepped backward, trying to push in the new case, and\nas I did so she moved on in little runs, dropping down after each run.\nThe danger was imminent, and the case would not go in. At the moment\nI oddly enough thought of the cartridge-maker, whose name I will not\nmention, and earnestly hoped that if the lion got me some condign\npunishment would overtake him. It would not go in, so I tried to pull it\nout. It would not come out either, and my gun was useless if I could\nnot shut it to use the other barrel. I might as well have had no gun.\nMeanwhile I was walking backward, keeping my eye on the lioness, who was\ncreeping forward on her belly without a sound, but lashing her tail\nand keeping her eye on me; and in it I saw that she was coming in a\nfew seconds more. I dashed my wrist and the palm of my hand against the\nbrass rim of the cartridge till the blood poured from them--look, there\nare the scars of it to this day!”\n\nHere Quatermain held up his right hand to the light and showed us four\nor five white cicatrices just where the wrist is set into the hand.\n\n“But it was not of the slightest use,” he went on; “the cartridge would\nnot move. I only hope that no other man will ever be put in such an\nawful position. The lioness gathered herself together, and I gave myself\nup for lost, when suddenly Tom shouted out from somewhere in my rear:\n\n“‘You are walking on to the wounded cub; turn to the right.’\n\n“I had the sense, dazed as I was, to take the hint, and slewing round at\nright angles, but still keeping my eyes on the lioness, I continued my\nbackward walk.\n\n“To my intense relief, with a low growl she straightened herself,\nturned, and bounded off farther up the kloof.\n\n“‘Come on, inkoos,’ said Tom, ‘let’s get back to the waggon.’\n\n“‘All right, Tom,’ I answered. ‘I will when I have killed those three\nother lions,’ for by this time I was bent on shooting them as I never\nremember being bent on anything before or since. ‘You can go if you\nlike, or you can get up a tree.’\n\n“He considered the position a little, and then he very wisely got up a\ntree. I wish that I had done the same.\n\n“Meanwhile I had found my knife, which had an extractor in it, and\nsucceeded after some difficulty in hauling out the case which had so\nnearly been the cause of my death, and removing the obstruction in the\nbarrel. It was very little thicker than a postage-stamp; certainly not\nthicker than a piece of writing-paper. This done, I loaded the gun,\nbound a handkerchief round my wrist and hand to staunch the flowing of\nthe blood, and started on again.\n\n“I had noticed that the lioness went into a thick green bush, or rather\ncluster of bushes, growing near the water; for there was a little stream\nrunning down the kloof, about fifty yards higher up and for this I made.\nWhen I got there, however, I could see nothing, so I took up a big stone\nand threw it into the bushes. I believe that it hit the other cub, for\nout it came with a rush, giving me a broadside shot, of which I promptly\navailed myself, knocking it over dead. Out, too, came the lioness like a\nflash of light, but quick as she went I managed to put the other bullet\ninto her ribs, so that she rolled right over three times like a shot\nrabbit. I instantly got two more cartridges into the gun, and as I did\nso the lioness rose again and came crawling toward me on her fore paws,\nroaring and groaning, and with such an expression of diabolical fury on\nher countenance as I have not often seen. I shot her again through the\nchest, and she fell over on to her side quite dead.\n\n“That was the first and last time that I ever killed a brace of lions\nright and left, and, what is more, I never heard of anybody else doing\nit. Naturally I was considerably pleased with myself, and having again\nloaded up, I went on to look for the black-maned beauty who had killed\nKaptein. Slowly, and with the greatest care, I proceeded up the kloof,\nsearching every bush and tuft of grass as I went. It was wonderfully\nexciting work, for I never was sure from one moment to another but that\nhe would be on me. I took comfort, however, from the reflection that\na lion rarely attacks a man,--rarely, I say; sometimes he does, as you\nwill see,--unless he is cornered or wounded. I must have been nearly an\nhour hunting after that lion. Once I thought I saw something move in a\nclump of tambouki grass, but I could not be sure, and when I trod out\nthe grass I could not find him.\n\n“At last I worked up to the head of the kloof, which made a cul-de-sac.\nIt was formed of a wall of rock about fifty feet high. Down this rock\ntrickled a little waterfall, and in front of it, some seventy feet from\nits face, was a great piled-up mass of boulders, in the crevices and on\nthe top of which grew ferns, grasses, and stunted bushes. This mass was\nabout twenty-five feet high. The sides of the kloof here were also very\nsteep. Well, I came to the top of the nullah and looked all round. No\nsigns of the lion. Evidently I had either overlooked him farther down or\nhe had escaped right away. It was very vexatious; but still three lions\nwere not a bad bag for one gun before dinner, and I was fain to be\ncontent. Accordingly I departed back again, making my way round the\nisolated pillar of boulders, beginning to feel, as I did so, that I was\npretty well done up with excitement and fatigue, and should be more so\nbefore I had skinned those three lions. When I had got, as nearly as I\ncould judge, about eighteen yards past the pillar or mass of boulders,\nI turned to have another look round. I have a pretty sharp eye, but I\ncould see nothing at all.\n\n“Then, on a sudden, I saw something sufficiently alarming. On the top\nof the mass of boulders, opposite to me, standing out clear against the\nrock beyond, was the huge black-maned lion. He had been crouching there,\nand now arose as though by magic. There he stood lashing his tail,\njust like a living reproduction of the animal on the gateway of\nNorthumberland House that I have seen a picture of. But he did not stand\nlong. Before I could fire--before I could do more than get the gun to my\nshoulder--he sprang straight up and out from the rock, and driven by the\nimpetus of that one mighty bound came hurtling through the air toward\nme.\n\n“Heavens! how grand he looked, and how awful! High into the air he flew,\ndescribing a great arch. Just as he touched the highest point of his\nspring I fired. I did not dare to wait, for I saw that he would clear\nthe whole space and land right upon me. Without a sight, almost without\naim, I fired, as one would fire a snap-shot at a snipe. The bullet told,\nfor I distinctly heard its thud above the rushing sound caused by the\npassage of the lion through the air. Next second I was swept to the\nground (luckily I fell into a low, creeper-clad bush, which broke the\nshock), and the lion was on the top of me, and the next those great\nwhite teeth of his had met in my thigh--I heard them grate against the\nbone. I yelled out in agony, for I did not feel in the least benumbed\nand happy, like Dr. Livingstone,--whom, by the way, I knew very\nwell,--and gave myself up for dead. But suddenly, at that moment, the\nlion’s grip on my thigh loosened, and he stood over me, swaying to and\nfro, his huge mouth, from which the blood was gushing, wide opened. Then\nhe roared, and the sound shook the rocks.\n\n“To and fro he swung, and then the great head dropped on me, knocking\nall the breath from my body, and he was dead. My bullet had entered in\nthe centre of his chest and passed out on the right side of the spine\nabout half way down the back.\n\n“The pain of my wound kept me from fainting, and as soon as I got my\nbreath I managed to drag myself from under him. Thank heavens, his great\nteeth had not crushed my thigh-bone; but I was losing a great deal of\nblood, and had it not been for the timely arrival of Tom, with whose aid\nI got the handkerchief from my wrist and tied it round my leg, twisting\nit tight with a stick, I think that I should have bled to death.\n\n“Well, it was a just reward for my folly in trying to tackle a family\nof lions single-handed. The odds were too long. I have been lame ever\nsince, and shall be to my dying day; in the month of March the wound\nalways troubles me a great deal, and every three years it breaks\nout raw. I need scarcely add that I never traded the lot of ivory at\nSikukuni’s. Another man got it--a German--and made five hundred pounds\nout of it after paying expenses. I spent the next month on the broad of\nmy back, and was a cripple for six months after that. And now I’ve told\nyou the yarn, so I will have a drop of Hollands and go to bed.”'),(7,'GREGORIO, By Percy Hemingway\n\n\n\n\nI--AT THE PARADISO\n\nThe Cafe Paradiso was full of people, for the inhabitants of Alexandria\nhad dined, and the opera season was over. The seats at every table were\noccupied, and the fumes of smoke from a hundred cigars partly hid the\nladies of the orchestra. As the waiters pushed aside the swing-doors\nof the buffet and staggered into the salon with whisky, absinthe, and\ncoffee, the click of billiard-balls was heard. The windows facing the\nsea were wide open, for the heat was intense, and the murmur of the\nwaves mingled with the plaintive voices of the violins.\n\nSeated by a table at the far end of the hall, Gregorio Livadas hummed\nsoftly an accompaniment to Suppe’s “Poete et Paysan,” puffing from time\nto time a cloudlet of blue smoke from his mouth. When the music ceased\nhe joined in the applause, leaning back happily in his chair as the\nmusicians prepared to repeat the last movement. Meanwhile his eyes\nwandered idly over the faces of his neighbors.\n\nWhen the last chord was struck he saw the women hurry down from the\nplatform and rush toward the tables where their acquaintances sat. He\nheard them demand beer and coffee, and they drank eagerly, for fiddling\nin that heat was thirsty work. He watched the weary waiters hastening\nfrom table to table, and he heard the voices around him grow more\nanimated and the laughter more frequent. One man was fastening a spray\nof flowers on the ample bosom of the flautiste, while another sipped\nthe brown lager from the glass of the big drum, and the old wife of the\nconductor left her triangle and cymbals to beg some roses from an Arab\nflower-girl. Truly the world was enjoying itself, and Gregorio smiled\ndreamily, for the sight of so much gaiety pleased him. He wished one of\nthe women would come and talk to him; he would have liked to chat with\nthe fair-haired girl who played the first violin so well. He began to\nwonder why she preferred that ugly Englishman with his red face and bald\nhead. He caught snatches of their conversation. Bah! how uninteresting\nit was! for they could barely understand each other. What pleasure did\nshe find in listening to his bad French? and in her native Hungarian\nhe could not even say, “I love.” Why had she not come to him, Gregorio\nLivadas, who could talk to her well and would not mumble like an idiot\nand look red and uncomfortable! Then he saw she was drinking champagne,\nand he sighed. Ah, yes, these English were rich, and women only cared\nfor money; they were unable to give up their luxuries for the sake of a\nman.\n\nBut at this thought Gregorio blushed a little. After all, there was\none woman--the only woman he ought to think of--who was not afraid of\nhardship for the sake of her husband. He tried to excuse himself by\narguing that the music had excited him; but he felt a little ashamed,\nand as a sop to his not yet quite murdered conscience got up and left\nthe cafe.\n\nWhen he turned into the Place Mehemet Ali he remembered suddenly that\nhe had wasted his evening. It was ten o’clock, too late to set about\nthe business he had intended. He was angry with himself now as well as\nashamed. He wandered up and down the square, looking at the statue of\nthe great khedive, silhouetted against the moonlight, and cursed at his\nmisfortunes.\n\nWhy should he, Gregorio Livadas, be in need of money? He had worked\nhard, but without success. He could have borne his ill luck had he alone\nbeen the sufferer, but he must consider his child--and, of course, his\nwife too. He was really fond of his wife in a way. But he smiled proudly\nas he thought of his son, for whom he schemed out a great future. He and\nXantippe would train the boy so carefully that he would grow up to be\na great man, and, what was more, a rich man. How they would laugh,\nall three, as they sat in the splendid cafes over their wine, at the\nhardships the father had endured! Still he must not forget the present,\nand he sorely needed money. He would go to Amos again. Amos was a rich\nman, very rich, and a filthy Jew. Amos could easily spare him some money\nand renew the last loan. He was going to be successful now and would\nbe able to pay good interest. What better investment could Amos have?\nSurely none. He was going to set up a cafe with the money at Tanta, or\nZagazig, or even Benhur,--yes, Benhur was the best,--where there were\nfew competitors. Then he would make a fortune, as other Greeks had done,\nand Amos would be paid in full. He was not extravagant, no; he had the\nbusiness instincts of his race. Half these rich merchants of Alexandria\nhad begun as he would begin; he would succeed as they had succeeded. The\nfuture was really hopeful, if he could only borrow a little capital.\n\nWith these thoughts surging through his brain Gregorio paced up and down\nthe pavements. At last he turned into the Rue des Soeurs and started\nslowly toward his home.\n\nThis street, the sink of Alexandria, was at its gayest. The cafes where\ncheap liquor is sold were crowded. Soldiers and sailors, natives and the\nriffraff of half a dozen nations, jostled one another. The twanging of\nguitars and the tinkling of pianos was heard from every house. Women,\nunderclothed and overpainted, leaned from the upper windows and made\nfrequent sallies into the street to capture their prey. Loud voices sang\nlusty English choruses and French chansonnettes, and Neapolitan songs\ntried to assert themselves whenever the uproar ceased for a moment.\nEvery one talked his, or her, own tongue, and gesture filled in the gaps\nwhen words were wanting. All seemed determined to degrade themselves as\nmuch as possible, and nearly every one seemed supremely happy.\n\nOccasionally there was a fight, and knives were used with unerring\nskill; but the mounted police who patrolled the streets, though\novertaxed, managed to preserve a certain amount of order.\n\nGregorio took very little notice of the scenes through which he passed.\nHe knew every inch and corner of the quarter that had been his home for\nyears, and was familiar with most of its inhabitants. He sighed a little\nas he thought of the money being lost and won in the stuffy ill-lighted\nrooms at the back of the houses, shut out from view of the authorities.\nLike most of his race, he was fond of the excitement of gambling. But\nof what use were regrets and sighs? he had no money, and must needs go\nhome. It was vain to try and borrow or to ask credit for his losses; in\nthese gambling hells what is lost must be immediately paid, for tempers\nare inflamed by drink and knives are worn at each player’s belt.\n\nBut he sighed, none the less, at the hard necessity that compelled him\nto pass down the street without once entering the doors of a tavern. It\nwas very hot, and he had smoked many cigarettes. He would have been glad\nto call for a drink. The tavern-keepers, though they were his friends,\nexpected to be paid. One or two women beckoned to him, who would have\nwillingly offered him wine, but he was proud enough to ignore them.\n\nHe became more moody and dejected as he went along, silent and sober\namid so much revelry. When he reached his house he saw a drunken man\nlying on the threshold asleep. He stooped to look into his face and\nrecognised an Englishman, the foreman of some tramp in the harbour. He\nkicked the recumbent form testily as he strode over it.\n\n“These English, what beasts they are!” he growled, “and I--I have not a\npiastre for a single glass of wine.”\n\n\n\n\nII--CONCERNING A DEBT\n\nGregorio found, on entering his house, that his wife was already in bed.\nHe went into the tiny kitchen and saw a plate of macaroni ready for\nhis supper. He tried to eat some, but it stuck in his throat. He took a\nbottle of cheap Cretan wine from a shelf and drank from it; but the wine\nwas sour, and he spat it from his mouth with a curse.\n\nTaking up the lamp, he went into the bedroom. His wife was fast\nasleep with the boy in her arms. For a moment a smile flickered round\nGregorio’s mouth as he looked at them. Then he took off his boots and\nhis coat, blew out the lamp, and lay beside them. He was very tired\nafter his long tramp in the hot streets, but he could not sleep. Angrily\nhe tossed from side to side and closed his eyes tightly; but it was no\ngood, sleep would not come.\n\nAt midnight he heard a call to prayer chanted from the minaret of a tiny\nmosque in the neighbourhood. The muezzin’s voice irritated him. He\ndid not wish to pray, and he did want to sleep. He swore that it was\ninsanity for these fools of Mohammedans to declare that prayer was\nbetter than sleep.\n\nThen the thoughts that had agitated him during the walk returned to him.\nThe Rue des Soeurs was still noisy with merry-makers, and it seemed to\nhim that if he could only join them he would be happy. But he had no\nmoney, and one can do nothing without money!\n\nThen there came back to him the face of the Englishman he had seen\ntalking to the violinist of the Paradiso. He hated the man because he\nwas ugly and rich. These English were all rich, and yet they seemed to\nhim a miserable race, mere ignorant bullies. He remembered how often he\nhad come to the help of the English travellers who filled Egypt. Why had\nhe, he asked himself, for the sake of a miserable reward, prevented them\nbeing cheated, when he, with all his talents, was condemned to starve?\nEven his child, he thought, would grow to hate him if he remained poor.\nHe must get money. Amos would have to lend him some. The Jews were\nunpopular among the Greeks; it were wise to keep on good terms with\nthem, as Amos would find out.\n\nAt last he fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning his troubles began again. There was no coffee, and only a\nlittle Arab bread, and when that was done they must starve if they could\nnot get some money. Gregorio tore off a bit of bread and ate it slowly,\nlooking at his wife, who sat weeping beside him.\n\n“I shall go to Amos,” he said, firmly.\n\n“Ah, yes, to Amos,” Xantippe answered quietly; “but it will be no good.”\n\n“Why no good?”\n\n“Because you owe him money, and he will give you no more till he is\npaid.”\n\n“But we cannot pay him. He must let us have some. If not--” and Gregorio\nraised threatening.\n\nHis wife smiled sadly and kissed him.\n\n“You will not frighten Amos, my love. When I told him the child had been\nill, he only laughed.”\n\n“When was that?”\n\n“Yesterday.”\n\n“Then he had been here?”\n\n“He came last night to ask for his money. I told him we had none, and\nhe laughed and said we must get some. He told me I might get some if I\ncared to. He said I could make, oh, so much!”\n\nGregorio scowled savagely. “The filthy Jew! he said that? Never, never,\nnever!”\n\n“But we must get some money,” the woman sobbed, “if only for our son’s\nsake, Gregorio. But not that way?”\n\n“No, not that way,” he replied, savagely.\n\n“When shall you go to him?”\n\n“Now.”\n\nAnd taking up his hat he rushed into the street. He was terribly angry,\nnot so much at the purport of the Jew’s speech as at the man who made\nit. He loathed the Jews, and felt insulted when spoken to by one; it was\na terrible matter to ask this man for help, but it was intolerable that\nhis wife should suffer insult. And yet the child must be fed. Yes, she\nhad said that, and it was true. They must make sacrifices for the child.\n\nHe soon reached the Jew’s house, and was shown by a richly clad servant\ninto the room where Amos sat. Amos was an old man, tall and strong, with\na long bushy beard, in which his fingers continually played; and his\neyes were sharp and brilliant and restless, a strange contrast to his\nstately bearing and measured movements. He rose from his cushions as\nGregorio entered, and saluted him courteously, motioning him to a seat.\nThen, having resettled himself, he clapped his hands together smartly\nand ordered the servant who answered the summons to bring in coffee and\npipes.\n\nGregorio was rather overawed at the luxury he saw around him, and he\nfelt the stern-looking, polite old man would be a difficult person to\ndeal with. As he puffed at his tube he considered carefully what words\nhe should use.\n\nFor some time neither spoke, but Amos was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n“You heard I was at your house last night, and so have come to pay me?”\n\n“Yes, I heard you were at my house and that you wanted to be paid. You\nare a rich man, and I am poor.”\n\n“Nay, I am not rich; they lie who say I am rich.”\n\n“It is twenty pounds I owe you, is it not?”\n\n“Yes, twenty pounds. It is a large sum, and I have dealt generously with\nyou. I am now in need of it myself.”\n\n“I am a poor man.”\n\n“You have not the money, eh, my friend?”\n\n“I have not the money. But I will pay you if you will lend me some more.\nI shall be successful now; only twenty pounds more.”\n\nAmos appeared unmoved at the tremor in Gregorio’s voice. His eyes rested\ncoldly on the face of his client, while the unfortunate Greek continued\nto speak rapidly of his troubles and hopes. He smiled sarcastically as\nGregorio spoke of the certainty of making his fortune at Benhur, and\nremained quite unmoved at the story of the sufferings of a woman and\nchild from hunger and want.\n\n“Your wife is beautiful,” was all he answered when Gregorio paused for\na moment. At these words, however, he half rose from his place and\nclinched his hands savagely. But he sank back again with the remembrance\nthat a show of temper would not advance his cause.\n\n“Very beautiful,” he answered, chokingly; “would you see her starve?”\n\n“She is not my wife,” said Amos, quietly. Then he continued slowly,\npausing at intervals to puff out a cloud of smoke from his mouth:\n\n“You have owed me this money a long time. I want it, and I will have it.\nEven in Egypt there is law. You do not like us Jews, but the law will\nprotect me as long as I am rich enough to buy justice. In three days\nyou will pay me this money. I have been generous to you; now I will be\ngenerous no longer. If I am not paid I will take measures to recover my\nloss. You will sleep in the streets like the Arabs, my friend; but\nthe weather is warm. It is early summer, so you will scarcely feel the\nexposure. In three days you will come and pay me.”\n\n“But how am I to get the money? If you would lend me only a few pounds I\nwould repay you all I owe.”\n\n“Already you owe me more than you can pay. You can make money. You are\nmarried. These Christian women are worse than the Arabs; do I not see\nthem as I come home in the evening from my business? It is not right to\nborrow and not repay. I need my money. How can I have my coffee and my\npipe unless I have money?”\n\nGregorio listened with growing anger, and finally rose from his seat and\nshook his fist in the old man’s face.\n\n“You shall be paid,” he shouted, “you shall be paid!”\n\n“Anger is useless, my friend.”\n\nAnd as Gregorio left the house Amos smiled and stroked his beard.\n“Truly,” he thought, “these Christians hate us, but we have them in our\npower. It is pleasant to be hated and yet to know that it is to us they\nmust cringe when they are in need; and it is very pleasant to refuse. My\nfriend Gregorio is not happy now that he is struggling in my grasp.”\n\nAs for Gregorio, he wandered away toward the harbour, kicking savagely\nat the refuse scattered along the pavement. He did not know how to set\nabout earning the requisite sum. It was no good applying to the hotels\nor tourist agencies, for there were few visitors in the city and\ndragomen were therefore not needed.\n\nHis friends were too poor to help him, and the consul was unable to do\nmuch for him, there were so many poor Greeks who wanted help. Meanwhile\nthere was no food at home and no drink; even the necessaries of life\nwere lacking.\n\nOn arriving at his home he found his wife and child huddled in a corner\ncrying for food. They ran toward him as he entered, but the hope in\ntheir faces quickly faded at the sight of him.\n\n“It’s no good,” Gregorio growled; “Amos refuses to advance a piastre and\nsays I must pay all I owe in three days.”\n\n“It is impossible to sleep when one is hungry,” said Gregorio that night\nto his wife, who lay awake, weeping, beside him.\n\n\n\n\nIII--OF FAILURE AND A RESOLVE\n\nGregorio’s dreams, when he did sleep, were none of the pleasantest,\nand when he woke up, from time to time, he heard his wife weeping. In\nwondering what he should say to comfort her he fell asleep again, and\nsleeping was worse than lying awake. For in his dreams he saw Xantippe\nand his child starving and crying for food, and he was unable to help\nthem in any way. He lived over again the long day he had spent tramping\nthe streets of Alexandria searching for work. He saw the few tourists\nstill left in the town fat and happy; he saw the porters of the hotels\nwho had smiled on him pityingly and yet contemptuously; and he woke,\nafter each representation of the crude comedy, hot and yet cold with\nperspiration, to feel the bed on which he lay shaking under the sobs of\nhis wife.\n\nWhen at last day dawned Gregorio raised himself with an oath, and swore\nto find food for his family and work for himself. The terrible debt he\nowed to Amos he swore should not trouble him, laughing at his wife’s\nremonstrances. With the bright daylight had come a new courage, and,\nhungry as he was, he felt able not only to satisfy their hunger, but so\nskilfully to arrange matters that they would never feel hungry again.\nYet is was a terrible ordeal, that half-hour when the family should have\nsat down to a table laden with food. The poor wife cried, and he had\nto comfort her tears with promises, unsubstantial nutriment indeed,\nand they could not satisfy the child, who failed dismally to understand\nthem. Through the green blinds came the noise of life and health and\nmerriment; curses too, sometimes, but only the curses of the well fed,\nand therefore meaningless. Already the sun fell hot and indomitable on\nthe room, and the atmosphere at their touch became stifling. Gregorio,\nswallowing his tears, tore out into the street, shouting up the narrow\nstairway hysterical words of hope.\n\nHow long and shadowless the street seemed! Every house had its green\nblinds closely shut; the wind that stirred the dust of the pavements was\nhot and biting. Gregorio clinched his hands and strode rapidly onward.\nWhat mattered it to him that behind those green blinds women and men\nslumbered in comparative comfort? He had a work to do, and by sunset\nmust carry good tidings to his little world. For a time his heart was\nbrave as the dry wind scorched the tear upon his cheek. “Surely,” he\nthought, weaving his thoughts into a fine marching rhythm, “the great\nGod will help me now, will help me now.”\n\nAt midday, after he had tried, with that strange Greek pertinacity that\nunderstands no refusals, all the hotels and tourist agencies he had\ncalled at the day before, he became weary and disconsolate. The march\nhad become a dirge; no longer it suggested happiness to be, but failure.\nAn Englishman threw him a piastre, and he turned into a cafe. Calling\nfor a glass of wine, he flung himself down on the wooden bench and tried\nto think. But really logical thinking was impossible. For in spite of\nthe sorrow at his heart, the same bright dreams of wealth and happiness\ncame back to mock him. The piastre he played with became gold, and he\nfelt the cafe contained no luxuries that he might not command to be\nbrought before him. But as the effects of the red wine of Lebanon\nevaporated he began to take a soberer though still cheerful view of his\nposition. It was only when the waiter carried off his piastre that he\nsuddenly woke to fact and knew himself once more a man with a wife and\nchild starving in Alexandria, an alien city for all its wealthy colony\nof Greeks. A wave of pity swept over him; not so much for the woman was\nhe sorry, though he loved her too, but for the baby whose future he had\nplanned. He scowled savagely at the inmates of the cafe, who only smiled\nquietly, for they were used to poor Greeks who had drunk away their last\ncoin, and pushed past them into the street.\n\nThere it was hotter than ever, and he met scarcely any one. Every\none who could be was at home, or in the cool cafes; only Gregorio was\nabroad. He determined to make for the quay. He knew that many ships put\ninto the Alexandrian waters, and there was often employment found\nfor those not too proud to work at lading and unloading. Quickly, and\nburning as the kempsin, he hurried through the Rue des Soeurs, not\ndaring to look up at the house wherein he dwelt. The muffled sounds\nof voices and guitars from the far-away interiors seemed to mock his\nfootsteps as he passed the wine-shops; and all the other houses were\nsilent and asleep. At last he arrived on the quay, and the black lines\nof the P. and O. stood out firmly before him against the pitiless blue\nof sea and sky. He wandered over the hot stone causeway, but found no\none. The revenue officers were away, and not a labourer, not a sailor,\nwas visible. Beyond the breakwater little tufts of silvery foam flashed\non the rollers, and a solitary steamer steered steadily for the horizon.\nHe could see the Greek flag at her stern, and his eyes filled with\ntears. Ah, how little his friends in Athens thought of the man who had\ncome to find fame and fortune in the far-off East! He sat down on the\nparapet and watched the vessel until she became a tiny speck on the\nhorizon, and then he recommenced his search for work. His heart was\nbraver for a moment because of its pangs; he swore he would show these\ncountrymen of his who dwelt at home, and who in three days would see the\nvery ship he had been gazing at arrive in Grecian waters, that he was\nworthy of his country and his kinsfolk.\n\nBut resolutions were useless, tenacity of purpose was useless. For two\nlong hours he wandered by the harbour, but met no one.\n\nAt last the sun fell behind the western waves, and the windows of the\nkhedive’s palace glowed like a hundred flaming eyes; the flags fell from\nthe masts of the vessels; on the city side was a sudden silence, save\nfor the melancholy voices of the muezzins; then the day died; the bright\nstars, suddenly piercing the heavens, mocked him with their brilliance\nand told him that his useless search for bread was over.\n\nGregorio went back slowly to his home. Already the Rue des Soeurs was\ncrowded. The long street rang with music and laughter, and instead\nof blinds covering the windows merry women leaned upon the sills and\nlaughed at the crowds below.\n\nGregorio, when he reached his house, would have liked to go straight to\nbed. But it was not to be, for as he entered the tiny room he heard his\nwife trying to persuade the hungry infant into sleep, and his footsteps\ndisturbed her tears. He had to calm them as best he could, and as he\nsoothed her he noticed the child had a crust in his hand which he gnawed\nhalf contentedly. At the same moment the dim blue figure of an Arab\npassed by the opposite wall, and had almost gained the door ere Gregorio\nfound words.\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“It is Ahmed,” his wife answered, gently, placing her trembling hand\nupon his shoulder; “he too has children.”\n\nGregorio scowled and muttered, “An Arab,” and in that murmur none of the\nloathing was hidden that the pseudo-West bears for the East.\n\n“The child is starving,” said Ahmed. “I have saved the child; maybe some\nday I shall save the father.” And Ahmed slipped away before Gregorio\ncould answer him.\n\nFor a while neither he nor his wife spoke; they stood silent in the\nmoonlight. At last Gregorio asked huskily, “Have you had food?”\n\n“Not to-day,” was the answer; and the sweet voice was almost discordant\nin its pathos as it continued, “nor drink, and but for Ahmed the boy had\ndied.”\n\nGregorio could not answer; there was a lump in his throat that blocked\nwords, opening the gate for sobs. But he choked down his emotion with\nan effort and busied himself about the room. Xantippe sat watching him\nanxiously, smoothly with nervous fingers the covering of her son’s bed.\n\nAs the night advanced the heat increased, and all that disturbed the\nsilence of the room was the echo of the streets. Gregorio walked to the\nwindow and looked out. Below him he saw the jostling crowd of men and\nwomen. These people, he thought, were happy, and two miserables only\ndwelt in the city--his wife and himself. And whenever he asked himself\nwhat was the cause of his misery, the answer was ever the same--poverty.\nHe glanced at his son, tossing uneasily in his bed; he looked at\nhis wife, pale and haggard in the moonlight; he remembered his\nown sufferings all day long in the hot cruel streets, and he spoke\nunsteadily:\n\n“Xantippe?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I have thought over things.”\n\n“And I too.”\n\n“We are starving,--you are starving, and I am starving,--and all day\nlong I tramp these cursed streets, but gain nothing. So it will go on,\nday in, day out. Not only we ourselves, but our son too must die. We\nmust save him.”\n\n“Yes,” said Xantippe, quietly, repeating her husband’s words as she\nkissed the forehead of her child, “we must save him.”\n\n“There is only one way.”\n\n“Only one way,” repeated Xantippe, dreamily. There was a pause, and\nthen, as though the words had grown to have a meaning to her that she\ncould not fathom, she queried, “What way, Gregorio?”\n\n“That,” he said, roughly, as he caught her by the wrist, and, dragging\nher to the window, pointed to the women in the street beneath.\n\nXantippe hid her face on her husband’s breast and cried softly, while\nshe murmured, “No, no; I will never consent.”\n\n“Then the child will die,” answered the Greek, curtly, flinging her from\nhim.\n\nAnd the poor woman cast herself upon the bed beside her boy, and when\nher tears ceased for a moment stammered, “When?”\n\n“To-morrow,” was the answer, cruel and peremptory. And as Gregorio\nclosed the lattice, shutting out the noise of song and laughter, the\nroom echoed with the mighty sobbing of a woman who was betrayed, and who\nrepeated hysterically, while kissing the face of her child, “To-morrow,\nto-morrow there will be food for you.”\n\nAnd Gregorio slept peacefully, for the danger of starvation was over; he\nwould yet live to see his son become rich.\n\nAnd the woman?\n\nHe kissed her before he slept, and women always cry.\n\n\n\n\nIV--CONCERNING TWO WOMEN\n\nGregorio felt a little bit ashamed of himself next morning. The\nexcitement had passed, and the full meaning of his words came back to\nhim and made him shudder. The sun, already risen, sent shafts of light\nbetween the lips of the wooden lattice. A faint sound of life and\nmovement stole upward from the street below. But Xantippe and the boy\nstill slumbered, though the woman’s form shook convulsively at times,\nfor she sobbed in her sleep.\n\nGregorio looked at the two for a minute and then raised himself with\nan oath. The woman’s heavy breathing irritated him, for, after all, he\nargued, it was her duty as well as his to sacrifice herself for the lad.\nMoreover, the Jew must be paid, and to-day was that appointed by Amos\nfor the settling of their account. There was no money to pay it with,\nand they must lose their furniture, so much at least was certain. But\nAmos would not have the best of the bargain, thought the Greek as he\nlooked round the room with a grin, and the certainty that he had got\nthe better of Amos for the moment cheered his spirits. Then, too, after\nto-day there would be plenty to eat, for his wife could manage to earn\nmoney; nor was the man so mean in his villainy as to shirk any effort to\nearn money himself. After first looking at his wife critically and with\na satisfied smile, he touched her on the shoulder to wake her.\n\n“I am going out for work,” he said, as Xantippe opened her eyes.\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Good-bye.”\n\nBut Xantippe answered not. She turned her face to the wall wearily as\nGregorio left her.\n\nEntering the street he made straight for Amos’s house, and told the\nporter, who was still lying on the trestle before the door, that he\ncould not pay the Jew’s bill. Then without waiting for an answer, he\nhurried off to the quay.\n\nWith better luck than on the previous day, he managed to obtain\nemployment for some hours. The Greek mail-boat had arrived, and under\nthe blazing sun he toiled good-humouredly and patiently. The work\nwas hard, but it gave him no opportunity of thinking. He had to be\ncontinually dodging large bales of fruit and wine, and if he made a\nmistake the officer on duty would shout at him angrily, “Lazy dog! you\nwould not have left Greece were you not an idle fellow.” Such words\nwounded his pride, and he determined to do so well that he should earn\npraise. But the little officer, his bright buttons flashing in the\nsunlight, who smoked quietly in the intervals of silence, never praised\nanybody; but he left off abusing Gregorio at last, and when work ceased\nfor the day bade him come again on the morrow.\n\nAt sunset Gregorio pocketed his few hard-earned piastres and wandered\ncityward. He did not care to go back to his home, for he knew there\nwould be miserable stories to tell of the Jew’s anger, and, moreover,\nhe was terribly thirsty. So he went into a little cafe--known as the\nPenny-farthing Shop--opposite his house and called for a flask of\nkephisa. As he sipped the wine he glanced up nervously at his window and\nwondered whether his wife had already left home. Were he sure that she\nhad, he would leave his wine untouched and hasten to look after his\nson and give him food. But until he knew Xantippe had gone he would not\nmove. The sobs of yesterday still disturbed him, and he was more than\nonce on the point of cancelling his resolves. But as the wine stirred\nhis blood he became satisfied with what he had done and said. The little\ncafe at Benhur that was to make his fortune seemed nearly in his grasp.\nHad he not, he asked himself, worked all day without a murmur? It was\nright Xantippe should help him.\n\nAs he sat dreamily thinking over these things, and watching the shadows\nturn to a darker purple under the oil-lamps, a woman spoke to him.\n\n“Well, Gregorio, are you asleep?”\n\n“No,” said he, turning toward his questioner.\n\nThe woman laughed. She was a big woman, dressed in loose folds of red\nand blue. Her hair was dishevelled, and ornamented with brass pins\nfastened into it at random. Her sleeves were rolled up to her armpits,\nand she had her arms akimbo--fat, flabby arms that shook as she laughed.\nHer eyes were almost hidden, she screwed them up so closely, but her\nwide mouth opened and disclosed a row of gigantic, flawless teeth.\n\nGregorio frowned as he looked at her. He knew her well and had never\nliked her. But he dare not quarrel with her, for he owed her money, and\n“for the love of his black eyes,” as she told him, she had ever a bottle\nof wine ready for him when he wished.\n\n“Well, my good woman,” he blurted out, surlily, “you seem to be amused.”\n\n“I am, Gregorio. Tell me,” she continued, slyly, seating herself beside\nhim and placing her elbows on the table, “how is she?”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Xantippe. She came to me to-day, and I saw she had been crying. But I\nsaid nothing, because it is not always wise to ask questions. I thought\nshe wept because she was hungry and because the baby was hungry. I\noffered her food and she took some, but so little, scarcely enough to\ncover a ten-piastre piece. ‘That is for the baby,’ I said; ‘now some for\nyou.’ But she refused.”\n\n“Perhaps she had food for herself,” said Gregorio, shifting uneasily in\nhis chair.\n\n“Perhaps,” said the woman, and laughed again, more loudly than ever,\ntill the table shook. “But she asked me for something else,” she\ncontinued, when her merriment languished for want of breath; “she asked\nme to let her have an old dress of mine, a bright yellow-and-red dress,\nand she borrowed some ornaments. It is not right of you, Gregorio, to\nkeep an old friend on the door-step when you have a fantasia.”\n\nGregorio scowled savagely. After a pause he said, “I don’t know why my\nwife wanted your dress and ornaments.”\n\n“Oh yes, you do, friend Gregorio.” And she laughed again, this time\na suppressed, chuckling laugh that threatened to choke her; and she\nsupported her chin on her hands, while her eyes peered through the\nenveloping fat at the man who sat opposite to her. Suddenly she stood\nup, and taking Gregorio by the arm dragged him to the door.\n\n“See, there she goes. My garments are cleverly altered and suit her\nfinely, don’t they? Ah, well, my friend, a man who cannot support a wife\nshould marry a woman who can support him.”\n\nGregorio did not stop to answer her, but pushed past her into the\nstreet. The woman watched him enter the house opposite, and then\nreturned quietly to her work. But there was a smile hovering round her\nlips as she murmured to herself, “Ah, well, in time.”\n\nGregorio meanwhile had run up to his room and entered it breathless with\nexcitement. The first glance told him that Amos had seized all he\ncould, for nothing remained save a wooden bench and one or two coarse,\nhalf-disabled cooking utensils.\n\nGregorio swore a little as he realised what had happened. Then he saw in\na corner by the window his son and Ahmed.\n\n“She has gone,” said Ahmed, as Gregorio’s gaze rested on him. But she\nmight have gone merely to market, or to see a neighbour, for all the\nimperturbable Arab face disclosed. As soon as he had spoken the man bent\nover the child, laughing softly as the youngster played with his beard.\nFor the Arab, as he is miscalled, is fond of children, and there are\nnone to whom children take so readily as to the Egyptian fellahin.\n\nGregorio watched the two for a moment, and then placing his remaining\npiastres in the man’s hand bade him bring food and wine. As soon as\nhe was left alone with his son, he flung himself down on the floor and\nkissed, “You shall be a great man, ay, a rich man, my son.”\n\nHe repeated the sentence over and over again, punctuating it with\nkisses, while the two-year-old regarded him wonderingly, until Ahmed\nreturned.\n\nWhen the meal was ended Gregorio took the boy in his arms and sang to\nhim softly till at last the infant slept. Then he placed him gently on\nthe floor, having first made of his coat a bed, and went to the window\nand flung back the shutters. He smoked quietly as the minutes went by,\nwaiting impatiently for his wife to return. It seemed to him monstrous\nthat the boy who was to inherit a fortune should be sleeping on the\ndirty floor wrapped in an old coat; that an Arab, a mere fellah, should\namuse his son and play with him, when Greek nurses were to be hired in\nAlexandria had one only the money. Long after midnight he heard a step\non the stairs, and a minute after the door opened. He recognised his\nwife’s footsteps, and he rose to meet her. As she came into the room she\nlooked quickly round, and seeing her son went toward him and kissed him.\nGregorio, half afraid, stood by the window watching her. She let her\nglance rest on him a minute, then she turned round and laid her cloak\nupon the floor.\n\n“Xantippe!”\n\nBut she did not answer.\n\n“Xantippe, I have fed our son. The good days are coming when we shall be\nrich and happy.”\n\nBut Xantippe was too busy folding out the creases of her cloak to\nnotice him. The moonlight streamed on to her, and her face shone like an\nangel’s. Gregorio made one step toward her, ravished, for she had never\nappeared so beautiful to him. For the moment he forgot the whole hideous\nhistory of the last few days and the brief, horrible conversation of the\nnight before. Fired with a desire to touch her, to kiss her, to\nwhisper into her ear, in the soft Greek speech, all the endearments and\ntendernesses that had won her when he wooed her, he placed his hand upon\nher arm. As if stung by a venomous snake, the woman recoiled from his\ntouch. With a quick movement she sprang back and flung at his face a\nhandful of gold and silver coins.\n\n“Take them; they’re yours,” she cried, huskily, and retreated into the\nfarthest corner of the room.\n\nWith a savage curse Gregorio put his hand to his lips and wiped away the\nblood, for a heavy coin had cut him. Then he ran swiftly downstairs, and\nXantippe, as she lay down wearily beside her boy, heard a woman laugh.\n\n\n\n\nV--XANTIPPE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW\n\nThe Penny-farthing Shop was full of customers, and Madam Marx, the\nfat woman who followed Gregorio to the bar, was for a long time busy\nattending to her clients. Some English war-ships had entered the harbour\nat sunset, and many of the sailors had lost no time in seeking out their\nfavourite haunt. Most of them knew Madam Marx well, as a good-natured\nwoman who gave them plenty to drink for their money, and secreted\nthem from the eyes of the police when the liquor overpowered them.\nConsequently there was much laughter and shaking of hands, and many a\nrough jest, which Madam Marx responded to in broken English. Gregorio\nwatched the sailors gloomily. He hated the English, for even their\nsailors seemed to have plenty of money, and he recalled the rich\nEnglishman he had seen at the Cafe Paradiso, drinking champagne and\nbuying flowers for the Hungarian woman who played the fiddle. The scene\nhe had just left contrasted disagreeably with the fun and jollity that\nsurrounded him. But he felt unable to shake off his gloom and annoyance,\nand Madam Marx’s attentions irritated him. He felt that her eyes\ncontinually rested on him, that, however busy she might be, he was never\nout of her thoughts. Every few minutes she would come toward him with a\nbottle of wine and fill up his glass, saying, “Come, my friend; wine\nis good and will drown your troubles.” And though he resented her\npatronage, knowing he could not pay, he nevertheless drank steadily.\n\nEvery few minutes he heard the sound of horses’ hoofs on the hard\nroadway, and through the windows he saw the military police pass slowly\non their rounds.\n\nAt last the strong drinks so amiably retailed by Madam Marx did their\nwork, and the men lay about the floor asleep and breathing heavily. The\nsilence succeeding the noise startled Gregorio from his sullen humour.\nMadam Marx came and sat beside him, weary as she was with her long\nlabours, and talked volubly. The wine had mounted to his head, and he\nanswered her in rapid sentences, accompanying his words with gesture and\ngrimace. What he talked about he scarcely knew, but the woman laughed,\nand he took an insane delight in hearing her. Just before daylight he\nfell asleep, resting his head on his arms, that were spread across\nthe table. Madam Marx kissed him as he slept, murmuring to herself\ncontentedly, “Ah, well, in time.”\n\nWhen Gregorio woke the sun was high in the heavens, blazing out of a\nbrazen sky. Clouds of dust swept past the door from time to time, and\ncut his neck and face as he stood on the threshold smoking lazily. It\nwas too late to go down to the quay, for his place must have long ago\nbeen filled by another. He was not sorry, since he by no means desired\nto toil again under the hot sun; the heavy drinking of the night had\nmade him lethargic, and he was so thirsty the heat nearly choked him.\nHe called out to a water-carrier staggering along in the scanty shade on\nthe opposite side of the street, and took eagerly a draught of water.\nHe touched the pigskin with his hand, and it was hot. The water was\nwarm and made him sick; he spat it from his mouth hastily, and hearing a\nlaugh behind him, turned round and saw Madam Marx.\n\n“See, here is some wine, my friend; leave the water for the Arabs.”\n\nGregorio gratefully seized the flagon and let the wine trickle down his\nthroat, while Madam Marx, with arms akimbo, stood patiently before him.\n\n“I must go now,” he said, as he handed back the half-emptied flask.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I must get some work.”\n\n“It is not easy to get work in the summer.”\n\n“I know, but I must get some. I owe money to Amos.”\n\n“Yes, I know. But your wife is making money now.”\n\nThe man scowled at her. “How do you know that? Before God, I swear that\nshe is not.”\n\n“Come, come, Gregorio. You were drunk last night, and your tongue wagged\npretty freely. It’s not a bit of use being angry with me, because I only\nknow what you’ve told me. Besides, I’m your friend, you know that.”\n\nGregorio flushed angrily at the woman’s words, but he knew quite well\nit was no use replying to them, for she was speaking only the truth. But\nthe knowledge that he had betrayed his secret annoyed him. He had grown\nused to the facts and could look at them easily enough, but he had not\nreckoned on others also learning them.\n\nHe determined to go out and find work, or at any rate to tramp the\nstreets pretending to look for something to do. The woman became\nintolerable to him, and the Penny-farthing Shop, reeking with the odour\nof stale tobacco and spilled liquor, poisoned him. He took up his hat\nbrusquely and stepped into the street.\n\nMadam Marx, standing at the door, laughed at him as she called out,\n“Good-bye, Gregorio; when will you come back?”\n\nHe did not answer, but the sound of her laughter followed him up the\nstreet, and he kicked angrily at the stones in his path.\n\nAt last he passed by the Ras-el-Tin barracks. He looked curiously at the\nEnglish soldiers. Some were playing polo on the hard brown space to\nthe left, and from the windows of the building men leaned out, their\nshirt-sleeves rolled up and their strong arms bared to the sun. They\nsmoked short clay pipes, and innumerable little blue spiral clouds\nmounted skyward. Obviously the heat did not greatly inconvenience them,\nfor they laughed and sang and drank oceans of beer.\n\nThe sight of them annoyed Gregorio. He looked at the pewter mugs shining\nin the sunlight. He eyed greedily the passage of one from hand to hand;\nand when one man, after taking a long pull, laughed and held it upside\ndown to show him it was empty, he burst into an uncontrollable fit of\nanger, and shook his fist impotently at the soldiers, who chaffed him\ngood-naturedly. As he went along by the stables, a friendly lancer,\npitying him, probably, too, wearying of his own lonely watch, called to\nhim, and offered him a drink out of a stone bottle. Gregorio drank again\nfeverishly, and handed the bottle back to its owner with a grin, and\npassed on without a word. The soldier watched him curiously, but said\nnothing.\n\nWhen he reached the lighthouse Gregorio flung himself on to the\npebble-strewn sand and looked across the bay. The blue water, calm and\nunruffled as a sheet of glass, spread before him. The ships--Austrian\nLloyd mail-boats, P. and O. liners, and grimy coal-hulks--lay motionless\nagainst the white side of the jetty.\n\nThe khedive’s yacht was bright with bunting, and innumerable\nfishing-boats near the breakwater made grateful oases in the glare\nwhereon his eyes might rest. But he heeded them not. Angrily he flung\nlumps of stone and sand into the wavelets at his feet, and pushed back\nhis hat that his face might feel the full heat of the sun. Then he lit a\ncigarette and began to think.\n\nBut what was the good of thinking? The thoughts always formed themselves\ninto the same chain and reached the same conclusion; and ever on the\nglassy surface of the Levantine sea a woman poised herself and laughed\nat him.\n\nWhen the sun fell behind the horizon, and the breakwater, after dashing\nup one flash of gold, became a blue blur, Gregorio rose to go. As\nhe walked back toward the Penny-farthing Shop he felt angry and\nunsatisfied. The whole day was wasted. He had done nothing to relieve\nhis wife, nothing to pay off Amos. Madam met him at the door, a flask of\nwine in her hand. Against his will Gregorio entered her cafe and smiled,\nbut his smile was sour and malevolent.\n\n“You want cheering, my friend,” said madam, laughing.\n\n“I have found nothing to do,” said Gregorio.\n\n“Ah! I told you it would be hard. There are no tourists in Alexandria\nnow. And it is foolish of you to tramp the streets looking for work that\nyou will never find, when you have everything you can want here.”\n\n“Except money, and that’s everything,” put in Gregorio, bluntly.\n\n“Even money, my friend. I have enough for two.”\n\nMadam Marx had played her trump card, and she watched anxiously the\neffect of her words. For a moment the man did not speak, but trifled\nwith his cigarette tobacco, rolling it gently between his brown fingers.\nThen he said:\n\n“You know I am in debt now, and I want to pay off all I owe, and leave\nhere.”\n\n“Yes, that’s true, but you won’t pay off your debts by tramping the\nstreets, and your little cafe at Benhur will be a long time building, I\nfancy. Meanwhile there is money to be made at the Penny-farthing Shop.”\n\n“What are your terms?” asked Gregorio, roughly.\n\nThe woman laughed, but did not answer. The stars were shining, and the\nkempsin that had blown all day was dead. It was cool sitting outside the\ndoor of the cafe under the little awning, and pleasant to watch the blue\ncigarette smoke float upward in the still air. Gregorio sat for a while\nsilent, and the woman came and stood by him. “You know my terms,” she\nwhispered, and Gregorio smiled, took her hand, and kissed her. At that\nmoment the blind of the opposite house was flung back. Xantippe leaned\nout of the window and saw them.\n\n\n\n\nVI--BABY AND JEW\n\nWhen the Penny-farthing Shop began to fill Gregorio disappeared quietly\nby the back door. He muttered a half-unintelligible answer to the men\nwho were playing cards in the dim parlour through which he had to pass,\nwho called to him to join them. Gaining the street, he wandered along\ntill he reached the bazaars, intending to waste an hour or two until\nXantippe should have left the house. Then he determined to go back and\nsee the boy in whom all his hopes and ambitions were centered, who was\nthe unconscious cause of his villainy and degradation.\n\nThere was a large crowd in the bazaars, for a Moolid was being\ncelebrated. Jugglers, snake-charmers, mountebanks, gipsies, and\ndancing-girls attracted hundreds of spectators.\n\nThe old men sat in the shadows of their stalls, smoking and drinking\ncoffee. They smiled gravely at the younger people, who jostled one\nanother good-humouredly, laughing, singing, quarrelling like children.\nAcross the roadway hung lamps of coloured glass and tiny red flags\nstamped with a white crescent and a star. Torches blazed at intervals,\ncasting a flickering glow on the excited faces of the crowd.\n\nGregorio watched without much interest. He had seen a great many\nfantasias since he came to Egypt, and they were no longer a novelty to\nhim. He was annoyed that a race of people whom he despised should be so\nmerry when he himself had so many troubles to worry him. He would have\nliked to go into one of the booths where the girls danced, but he had no\nmoney, and he cursed at his stupidity in not asking the Marx woman for\nsome. He no longer felt ashamed of himself, for he argued that he was\nthe victim of circumstances. Still he wished Xantippe had not looked out\nof the window, though of course he could easily explain things to her.\nAnd Xantippe was really so angry the night before, explanations were\nbetter postponed for a time. “After all,” he thought, “it really does\nnot much matter. Once we get over our present difficulties we shall\nforget all we have gone through.” This comfortable reflection had been\ndoing duty pretty often the last day or two, and though Gregorio did not\nbelieve it a bit, he always felt it was a satisfactory conclusion, and\none to be encouraged.\n\nMeanwhile he would not meet Xantippe. That was a point upon which he had\ndefinitely made up his mind. As he strolled through the bazaars, putting\ninto order his vagabond thoughts, in a tall figure a few yards in front\nof him he recognised Amos. Nervous, he halted, for he had no desire to\nbe interviewed by the Jew, and yet no way of escape seemed possible.\n\nNodding affably to the proprietor, he sat down on the floor of a shop\nhard by and watched Amos. The old man was evidently interested, for he\nwas laughing pleasantly, and bending down to look at something on the\nground. What it was Gregorio could not see. A knot of people, also\nlaughing, surrounded the Jew. Gregorio was curious to see what attracted\nthem, but fearful of being recognised by the old man. However, after a\nfew moments his impatience mastered him, and he stepped up to the group.\n\n“What is it?” he asked one of the bystanders.\n\n“Only a baby. It’s lost, I think.”\n\nGregorio pushed his way into the centre of the crowd and suddenly became\nwhite as death.\n\nThere, seated on the ground, was his own child, laughing and talking to\nhimself in a queer mixture of Greek and Arabic. Amos was bending kindly\nover the youngster, giving him cakes and sweets, and making inquiries as\nto the parents.\n\nA chill fear seized on Gregorio’s heart. He could not have explained the\ncause, nor did he stay and try to explain it. Quickly he broke into the\nmidst of the circle and, catching up the boy in his arms, ran swiftly\naway.\n\nHaving reached home, he kissed the boy passionately, sent for food to\nMadam Marx, and wept and laughed hysterically for an hour. After a time\nthe boy slept, and Gregorio then paced up and down the room, smoking,\nand puffing great clouds of smoke from his mouth, trying to calm\nhimself. But he could not throw off his excitement. He imagined the\nawful home-coming had he not been to the bazaar, and he wondered what he\nwould have done then. A great joy possessed him to see his son safe,\nand a fierce desire filled him to know who had taken the child away.\nHe longed for Xantippe’s return that he might tell her. He forgot\ncompletely that he had dreaded seeing her earlier this evening. Then he\nbegan to wonder what Amos was doing at the fantasia, and why he was so\ninterested in the boy. Perhaps, Amos would forgive the debt for love of\nthe child. The idea pleased him, but he soon came to understand that\nit was untenable. Oftener, indeed, he shuddered as he recalled the old\nman’s figure bent over the infant. A sense of danger to come overwhelmed\nhim. In some way he felt that the old man and the child were to be\nbrought together to work his, Gregorio’s, ruin.\n\nSuddenly he heard a footstep on the stairs. “Thank God!” he cried, as he\nran to the door.\n\n“Xantippe!”\n\nBut he recoiled as if shot, for as the door opened Amos entered. The Jew\nbowed politely to the Greek, but there was an unpleasant twinkle in his\neyes as he spoke.\n\n“You cannot offer me a seat, my friend, so I will stand. We have met\nalready this evening.”\n\nGregorio did not answer, but placed himself between the Jew and the\nchild.\n\n“I dare say you did not see me,” the old man continued, quietly, “for\nyou seemed excited. I suppose the child is yours. It was surely careless\nto let him stray so far from home.”\n\n“The child is mine.”\n\n“Ah, well, it is a happy chance that you recovered him so easily. And\nnow to business.”\n\n“I am listening.”\n\n“I have already, as of course you know, been here to see you about the\nmoney you owe me. I was sorry you did not see fit to pay me, because I\nhad to sell your furniture, and it was not worth much.”\n\n“I have no money to pay you, or I would have paid you long ago. I told\nyou when I went to your house that I could not pay you.”\n\n“And yet, my friend, it is only fair that a man who borrows money should\nbe prepared to pay it back.”\n\n“I could pay you back if you gave me time. But you have no heart, you\nJews. What do you care if we starve, so long as--”\n\n“Hush!” said Amos, gravely; “I have dealt fairly by you. But I will let\nyou go free on one condition.”\n\n“And that is?”\n\n“That you give me the child.”\n\nGregorio stood speechless with horror and rage at the window, and the\nold man walked across the room to where the infant lay.\n\n“I have no young son, Gregorio Livadas, and I will take yours. Not\nonly will I forgive you the debt, but I will give you money. I want the\nchild.”\n\n“By God, you shall not touch him!” cried Gregorio, suddenly finding\nvoice for his passion.\n\nHe rushed furiously at Amos, gripped him by the throat, and flung him\nto the far side of the room. Then he stood by his child with his arms\nfolded on his breast, his eyes flashing and his nostrils dilated. Amos\nquickly recovered himself, and, in a voice that scarcely trembled, again\ndemanded his money.\n\n“Go away,” shouted Gregorio; “if you come here again, I will kill you.\nTwice now have I saved my boy from falling into your hands.”\n\n“I wish only to do you a service. You are a beggar, and I am rich\nenough, ask Heaven, to look after the child. Why should you abuse me\nbecause I offer to release you from your debts if you will let me take\nthe child?”\n\nGregorio answered brusquely that the Jew should not touch the boy. “I\nwill not have him made a Jew.”\n\n“Then you will pay me.”\n\n“I will not. I cannot.”\n\n“I shall take measures, my friend, to force you to pay me. I have not\ndealt harshly with you. I came here to help you, and you have insulted\nme and beaten me.”\n\n“Because you are a dog of a Jew, and you have tried to steal my son.”\n\nA nasty look came into the Jew’s eyes,--a cold, cunning look,--and he\nwas about to reply when the door opened and Xantippe entered. She was\nwell dressed, and wore some ornaments of gold. Amos turned toward her,\nasking the man:\n\n“This is your wife?”\n\nBut Gregorio told Xantippe rapidly the history of his adventures with\nthe boy; and the woman, hearing them, moved quietly to the corner where\nhe slept, and took him in her arms.\n\nThe Jew smiled. “I see,” he said, “that madam has money. She has taken\nthe advice I gave you the other day. Now I know that you can pay me,\nand if you do not within two days, Gregorio Livadas, you will repent the\ninsults you have heaped on my head this night.”\n\nHe walked quietly to the corner of the room, where Xantippe sat nursing\nthe boy, touched the child gently on the forehead with his lips, and\nthen went out.\n\nFor some minutes neither Xantippe nor Gregorio spoke, but the man rubbed\nthe infant’s forehead with his finger as if to wipe out the stain of the\nJew’s kiss.\n\n\n\n\nVII--XANTIPPE SPEAKS OUT\n\nAt last the silence, roused only by the strident buzzing of the\nmosquitos, became unendurable. Gregorio gave a preparatory cough and\nopened his lips to speak, but the words refused to be born. He was\nunnerved. The odious visitor, the wearying day, the memory of Xantippe’s\nface at the window, combined to make him fearful. He watched, under his\nhalf-closed lids, his wife crouching on the far side of the boy. Once or\ntwice, as he was rubbing the youngster’s forehead, his fingers touched\nthose of his wife as she waved off the mosquitos; but at each contact\nwith them he shivered and his fears increased. He tried, vainly, to\nget his thoughts straight, and lit a cigarette with apparent calmness,\nswaggering to the window; but his legs did not cease to tremble, and the\nunsteadiness of his gait caused Xantippe to smile as she watched him.\nResting by the window, Gregorio widened the lips of the lattice and let\nin a stream of moonbeams that rested on wife and child, illumining the\ndark corner.\n\n“Gregorio!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you told me all? Is there nothing else to tell em about our son\nand the Jew?”\n\nGregorio felt he must now speak; it was not possible to keep silence\nlonger. He was pleased that his wife had begun the conversation, for it\nseemed easier to answer questions than to frame them. “I have told you\nthe whole story. There is no more to tell. It was by accident I found\nhim in the bazaar, and that devil Amos was bending over him. I could\nkill that man.”\n\n“What good would that do?”\n\n“Fancy if we had lost the boy! Think of the sacrifices we have made for\nhim, and they would have been useless.”\n\n“Have you made any sacrifices, Gregorio?”\n\nThe question was quietly asked, but there was a ring of irony in the\nsound of the voice, and Gregorio, to shun his wife’s gaze, moved into\nthe friendly shadows. For some minutes he did not answer. At length,\nwith a nervous laugh, he replied:\n\n“Of course. We have both made sacrifices, great sacrifices.”\n\n“It is odd,” pursued Xantippe, gently, as if speaking to herself, “that\nyou should so flatter yourself. You professed to care for me once; you\nonly regard me now as a slave to earn money for you.”\n\n“It is for our son’s sake.”\n\n“Is it for our son’s sake also that you sit with Madam Marx, that you\ndrink her wine, that you kiss her?”\n\nGregorio could not answer. He felt it were useless to try and explain,\nthough the reason seemed to him clear enough.\n\n“I am glad to have the chance,” continued Xantippe, “of talking to\nyou, for we may now understand each other. I have made the greatest\nsacrifice, and because it was for our son’s sake I forgave you. I wept,\nbut, as I wept, I said, ‘It is hell for Gregorio too.’ But when I looked\nfrom the window this afternoon I knew it was not hell for you. I knew\nyou did not care what became of me. It was pleasant for you to send\nme away to make money while you drank and kissed at the Penny-farthing\nShop. I came suddenly to know that the man had spoken truth.”\n\n“What man?” asked Gregorio, huskily.\n\n“The man! The man you bade me find. Because money is not gathered from\nthe pavements. You know that, and you sent me out to get money. When I\nfirst came back to you I flung the gold at you; it burned my fingers,\nand your eagerness for it stung. But I did not quite hate you, though\nhis words had begun to chime in my ears: ‘In my country such a husband\nwould be horsewhipped.’ When you were kind I was little more than a dog\nyou liked to pet. I thought that was how all women were treated. I know\ndifferently now. You will earn money through me, for it is my duty to my\nson, but you have earned something else.”\n\n“Yes?” queried Gregorio.\n\n“My hate. Surely you are not surprised? I have learned what love is\nthese last few days, have learned what a real man is like. I know you to\nbe what he called you, a cur and a coward. I should never have learned\nthis but for you, and I am grateful, very grateful. It is useless\nto swear and to threaten me with your fists. You dare not strike me,\nbecause, were you to injure me, you would lose your money. You have\ntried to degrade me, and you have failed. I am happier than I have ever\nbeen, and far, far wiser. When a woman learns what a man’s love is,\nshe becomes wiser in a day than if she had studied books for a hundred\nyears.”\n\nXantippe ceased speaking and, taking her son in her arms, closed her\neyes and fell asleep quietly, a gentle smile hovering round her lips.\n\nGregorio scowled at her savagely, and would have liked to strike her,\nto beat out his passion on her white breast and shoulders. But she had\nspoken only the truth when she said he dare not touch her. With impotent\noaths he sought to let off the anger that boiled in him. He feared\nto think, and every word she had uttered made him think in spite of\nhimself. The events of sixty hours had destroyed what little of good\nthere was in the man. Save only the idolatrous love for his child, he\nscarcely retained one ennobling quality.\n\nLittle by little his anger cooled, his shame died out of him, and he\nbegan to wonder curiously what manner of man this was whose words had so\nstirred his wife. Wondering he fell asleep, nor did he awaken till the\nsun was risen.\n\nWhile eating his breakfast he inquired cunningly concerning this wise\nteacher of the gospels of love and hate, but Xantippe for a time did not\nanswer.\n\n“Is he a Greek?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“A Frenchman?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“A German?”\n\n“No.”\n\nSuddenly Gregorio felt a kind of cramp at his heart, and he had to\npause before he put the next question. He could scarcely explain why\nhe hesitated, but he called to mind the Paradise cafe and the red-faced\nEnglishman. He was ready enough to sacrifice his wife if by so doing\nmoney might be gained, but he felt somehow hurt in his vanity at the\nidea of this ugly, slow-witted Northerner usurping his place. With an\neffort, however, he put the question:\n\n“Is he an Englishman?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe was seized with a tumult of anger. He spoke volubly, talking of the\nignorance of the English, their brutality, their dull brains, their\nstupid pride. Xantippe waited till he had finished speaking and then\nreplied quietly:\n\n“It cannot matter to you. It is my concern. You have lost all rights to\nbe angry with me or those connected with me.”\n\nGregorio refused to hear reason, and explained how he begrudged them\ntheir wealth and fame. “For these English are a dull people, and we\nGreeks are greatly superior.”\n\n“I do not agree with you,” Xantippe replied. “I have learned what a man\nis since I have known him, and I have learned to hate you. You may have\nmore brains--that I know nothing of, nor do I care. He could not behave\nas you have behaved, nor have sacrificed me as you have sacrificed me.\nSome of his money comes to you. You want money. Be satisfied.”\n\nGregorio felt the justice of her words, and he watched her put on her\nhat and leave the room. A minute later, looking out of the window, he\nsaw her link her arm in that of the Englishman of the Paradiso, and\nacross the street, at the threshold of the Penny-farthing Shop, Madam\nMarx waved her hand to himself and laughed.\n\n\n\n\nVIII--A DESOLATE HOME-COMING\n\nToward the evening of a day a fortnight later, Gregorio found himself\nseated in Madam Marx’s cafe, idly watching the passers-by. He was\nfeeling happier, for that was being amassed which alone could insure\nhappiness to him. Each day some golden pieces were added to the amount\nsaved, and the cafe at Benhur seemed almost within his grasp. The\nfeeling of security from want acted as a narcotic and soothed him, so\nthat the things which should have troubled him scarcely interested him\nat all. He was intoxicated with the sight of gold. When he had first\nseen Xantippe and the Englishman together his anger had been violent;\nbut when at last the futility of his rage became certain, his aggressive\npassion had softened to a smouldering discontent that hardly worried\nhim, unless he heard some one speak a British name. His prosperity had\ndestroyed the last vestiges of shame and soothed his illogical outbursts\nof fury. He was contented enough now to sit all day with Madam Marx,\nand returned to his home in the evening when Xantippe was away. He had\nspoken to her only once since she had told him she hated him. He had\nstrolled out of the cafe about midday and entered his room. Xantippe was\nthere, talking to her child, and quietly bade him go away.\n\n“It’s my room as well as yours,” Gregorio had answered.\n\n“It is my money that pays for it,” was the reply.\n\nA long conversation followed, but Xantippe met the man’s coarse anger\nwith quiet scorn, and told him that if he stayed she would grow to\ndislike her son since he was the father.\n\nGregorio was wise enough to control his anger then. For he knew that if\nshe were really to lose her love for the boy, all his chances, and the\nboy’s chances, of ease and prosperity would be destroyed. It was, of\ncourse, ridiculous to imagine she would supply him with money then.\nThat she thoroughly loathed him, and would always loathe him, was very\ncertain. So great, indeed, seemed her contempt for him that it was quite\npossible she might come to hate his child. So he did not attempt to\nremain in the room, but as he closed the door after him he waited a\nmoment and listened. He heard her heave a sigh of relief and then say\nto the little fellow, “How like your father you grow! My God! I almost\nthink I hate you for being so like him.” Gregorio shuddered as he ran\nnoiselessly downstairs. He never ventured to speak to her again. He\nargued himself out of the disquiet into which her words had thrown him.\nHe knew it was difficult for a woman to hate her child. The birth-pains\ncement a love it requires a harsh wrench to sever. He easily persuaded\nhimself, as he sipped Madam Marx’s coffee, that if he kept in the\nbackground all cause for hatred would be removed. As for her feelings\ntoward himself, he had ceased, almost, to care. The money was worth the\ncost paid in the attainment of it, and a woman’s laugh was less sweet to\nhim than the chink of gold and silver pieces. On the whole Gregorio\nhad little reason to be troubled; only unreasoning dislike for\nthe Englishman--why could not he be of any other nation, or, if an\nEnglishman, any other Englishman?--hurt his peace of mind. And for the\nmost part his discontent only smouldered.\n\nMadam Marx brought her coffee and sat beside him. Her face betokened\nsatisfaction, and she looked at Gregorio with a possessive smile. She\nhad gained her desire, and asked fortune for no other gift.\n\n“You have not seen Xantippe since she turned you out? Ah, well, it\nis much better you should keep away. You are welcome here, and it is\nfoolish to go where one is not wanted.”\n\n“I’ve not seen her; I’m afraid to see her.” He spoke openly to madam\nnow.\n\n“Some women are queer. If she had ever really loved you, she would not\nhave thrown you over. I should not have complained had I been in her\nplace. One cannot always choose one’s lot.”\n\n“It’s that damned Englishman who has spoiled her.”\n\n“Ah, yes, those English! I know them.”\n\n“Did I tell you what she said about the boy?”\n\n“Yes, my friend. But as long as you don’t worry her, her words need not\nworry you.”\n\n“They don’t, except sometimes at night. I wake up and remember them, and\nthen I am afraid.”\n\n“Why do you hate the Englishman? To my mind it is lucky for both of you\nthat this Englishman saw her. There are not men so rich as the English,\nand he is a rich Englishman. You are lucky.”\n\n“I hate him.”\n\n“Because he has stolen your wife’s love?” Madam Marx, as she put\nthe question, laid her fat hand upon Gregorio’s shoulder and laughed\nconfidently. The movement irritated him, but he never tried to resist\nher now.\n\n“No, not quite that. I’m used to it, and the money more than compensates\nme. But I hated the man when I first saw him in the Paradise. There\nwas a fiddler-woman he talked to, and he could scarcely make himself\nunderstood. He had money, and he gave her champagne and flowers. And I\nwas starving, and the woman was beautiful.”\n\nMadam tapped his cheek and smiled.\n\n“The woman can’t interest you now. Also you have money--his money.”\n\n“Still I hate him.”\n\n“You Greeks are like children. Your hatred is unreasonable; there is no\ncause for it.”\n\n“Unreasonable and not to be reasoned away.”\n\n“Well, why worry about him? He won’t follow you to Benhur, I fancy.”\n\n“It doesn’t worry me generally; but when you mention him my hate springs\nup again. I forget him when I am by myself.”\n\n“Forget him now.”\n\nAnd they drank coffee in silence.\n\nDarkness came on, and the blue night mist. Gregorio was impatient to\nsee his son. He gazed intently at the door of the opposite house,\nlittle heeding madam, who was busy with preparations for the evening’s\nentertainment of her customers. Suddenly he saw a woman leave the house,\nhail a passing carriage, and drive rapidly down the street toward the\nPlace Mehemet Ali. Gregorio, with a cry of pleasure, rose and left the\ncafe. Madam Marx followed him to the door and called a good-night to\nhim. Gregorio stood irresolutely in the middle of the road. He had\npromised the boy a boat, and he blamed himself for having forgotten to\nbuy it. Grumbling at his forgetfulness, he hurried along the street,\ndetermined to waste no time. On occasions he could relinquish his lazy,\nslouching gait, and he would hurry always to obey the commands of\nthe king his son. A pleasant smile at the thought of the pleasure his\npresent would cause softened the sinister mould of his lips, and he sang\nsoftly to himself as he moved quickly cityward.\n\nBefore he had gone many yards an oath broke in upon the music, and he\ndarted swiftly under the shadow of a wall; for coming forward him was\nAmos the Jew. But the old man’s sharp eyes detected the victim, and,\nfollowing Gregorio into his hiding-place, Amos laid his hand upon the\nGreek.\n\n“Why do you try to hide when we have so much to say to one another?”\n\nGregorio shook himself from the Jew’s touch and professed ignorance of\nthe necessity for speech.\n\n“Come, come, my friend, the money you borrowed is still owing in part.”\n\n“But you will be paid. We are saving money; we cannot put by all we\nearn--we must live.”\n\n“I will be paid now; if I am not, you are to blame for the\nconsequences.”\n\nAnd with a courtly salute the Jew passed on. Now Gregorio had not\nforgotten his debt, nor the Jew’s threats, and he fully intended to\npay what he owed. But of course it would take time, and the man was\ntoo impatient. He realised he had been foolish not to pay something on\naccount; but it hurt him to part with gold. He determined, however,\nto send Amos something when he returned home. So good a watch had been\nkept, he never doubted the child’s safety. But it would be awkward if\nAmos got him put in jail. So he reckoned up how much he could afford to\npay, and, having bought the toy, returned eagerly home. He ran upstairs,\nsinging a barcarole at the top of his voice, and rushed into the room,\nwaving the model ship above his head. “See here,” he cried, “is the\nship! I have not forgotten it.” But his shout fell to a whisper. The\nroom was empty.\n\nWith a heartbroken sob the man fell swooning on the floor.\n\n\n\n\nIX--A DISCOVERY AND A CONSPIRACY\n\nFor long he lay stretched out upon the floor in a state of\nhalf-consciousness. He could hear the mosquitos buzzing about his face,\nhe could hear, too, the sounds of life rise up from the street below;\nbut he was able to move neither arm nor leg, and his head seemed\nfastened to the floor by immovable leaden weights. That his son was lost\nwas all he understood.\n\nHow long he lay there he scarcely knew, but it seemed to him weeks. At\nlast he heard footsteps on the stairs. He endeavoured vainly to raise\nhimself, and, though he strove to cry out, his tongue refused to frame\nthe words. Lying there, living and yet lifeless, he saw the door open\nand Amos enter. The old man hesitated a moment, for the room was dark,\nwhile Gregorio, who had easily recognised his visitor, lay impotent on\nthe floor. Before Amos could become used to the darkness the door again\nopened, and Madam Marx entered with a lamp in her hand. Amos turned\nto see who had followed him, and, in turning, his foot struck against\nGregorio’s body. Immediately, the woman crying softly, both visitors\nknelt beside the sick man. A fierce look blazed in Gregorio’s eyes, but\nthe strong words of abuse that hurried through his brain would not be\nsaid.\n\n“He is very ill,” said Amos; “he has had a stroke of some sort.”\n\n“Help me to carry him to my house,” sobbed the woman, and she kissed\nthe Greek’s quivering lip and pallid brow. Then rising to her feet, she\nturned savagely on the Jew.\n\n“It is your fault. It is you who have killed him.”\n\n“Nay, madam; I had called here for my money, and I had a right to do so.\nIt has been owing for a long time.”\n\n“No; you have killed him.”\n\n“Indeed, I wished him well. I was willing to forgive the debt if he\nwould let me take the child.”\n\nA horrid look of agony passed over Gregorio’s face, but he remained\nsilent and motionless. The watchers saw that he understood and that a\ntempest of wrath and pain surged within the lifeless body. They\nstooped down and carried him downstairs and across the road to the\nPenny-farthing Shop. The Jew’s touch burned Gregorio like hot embers,\nbut he could not shake himself free. When he was laid on a bed in a\nroom above the bar, through the floor of which rose discordant sounds of\nrevelry, Amos left them. Madam Marx flung herself on the bed beside him\nand wept.\n\nTwo days later Gregorio sat, at sunset, by Madam Marx’s side, on the\nthreshold of the cafe. He had recovered speech and use of limbs. With\nwrathful eloquence he had told his companion the history of the terrible\nnight, and now sat weaving plots in his maddened brain.\n\nReplying to his assertion that Amos was responsible, Madam Marx said:\n\n“Don’t be too impetuous, Gregorio. Search cunningly before you strike.\nMaybe your wife knows something.”\n\n“My wife! Not she; she is with her Englishman. Amos has stolen the boy,\nand you know it as well as I do. Didn’t he tell you he wanted the child?\nI met him that night, and he told me if I did not pay I had only myself\nto blame for the trouble that would fall on me.”\n\n“Come, come, Gregorio, cheer up!” said the woman; for the Greek, with\nhead resting on his hands, was sobbing violently.\n\n“I tell you, all I cared for in life is taken from me. But I will have\nmy revenge, that I tell you too.”\n\nFor a while they sat silent, looking into the street. At last Gregorio\nspoke:\n\n“My wife has not returned since that night, has she?”\n\n“I have not seen her.”\n\n“Well, I must see her; she can leave the Englishman now.”\n\nMadam Marx laughed a little, but said nothing.\n\n“There is Ahmed,” cried Gregorio, as a blue-clad figure passed on the\nother side of the street. He beckoned to the Arab, who came across at\nhis summons.\n\n“You seem troubled,” he said, as he looked into the Greek’s face; and\nGregorio retold the terrible story.\n\n“You know nothing of all this?” he added, suspiciously, as his narrative\nended.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“My God! it is so awful I thought all the world knew of it. You often\nnursed and played with the boy?”\n\n“Ay, and fed him. We Arabs love children, even Christian children, and I\nwill help you if I can.”\n\n“Why should Amos want the boy?” asked Madam Marx, as she put coffee and\ntobacco before the guests.\n\n“Because I owe him money, and he knew the loss of my son would be the\ndeadliest revenge. He will make my son a Jew, a beastly Jew. By God, he\nshall not, he shall not!”\n\n“We must find him and save him,” said the woman.\n\n“He will never be a Jew. That is not what Amos wants your son for; there\nare plenty of Jews.” Ahmed spoke quietly.\n\n“They sacrifice children,” he continued, after a moment’s pause; “surely\nyou know that, and if you would save your boy there is not much time to\nlose.”\n\nGregorio trembled at Ahmed’s words. He wondered how he could have\nforgotten the common report, and his fingers grasped convulsively the\nhandle of his knife.\n\n“Let us go to Amos,” he said, speaking the words with difficulty, for he\nwas choking with fear for his son.\n\n“Wait,” answered the Arab; “I will come again to-night and bring some\nfriends with me, two men who will be glad to serve you. We Arabs are not\nsorry to strike at the Jews; we have our own wrongs. Wait here till I\ncome.”\n\n“But what will you do?” asked Madam Marx, looking anxiously on the man\nshe loved, though her words were for the Arab.\n\n“Gregorio will ask for his son. If the old man refuses to restore\nhim, or denies that he has taken him, then we will know the worst, and\nthen--”\n\nGregorio’s knife-blade glittered in the sunset rays, as he tested its\nsharpness between thumb and finger. The Arab watched with a smile.\n“We understand one another,” he said. There was no need to finish the\ndescription of his plan. With a solemn wave of his hand he left the\ncafe.\n\n“That man Ahmed,” said Madam Marx, “has a grudge against Amos. It\ndates from the bombardment, and he had waited all these years to avenge\nhimself. I believe it was the loss of his wife.”\n\n“Amos made her a Jewess, eh?” And then, after a pause, Gregorio added:\n\n“So we can depend on Ahmed. To-night I will win back my son or--”\n\n“Or?” queried madam, tremblingly.\n\n“Or Amos starts on his journey to hell. God, how my fingers itch to slay\nhim! The devil, the Jew devil!”\n\n\n\n\nX--AT THE HOUSE OF AMOS\n\nAs Ahmed had advised, Gregorio settled himself patiently to await the\nsummons. Madam would have liked to ask him many questions, and to have\nextracted a promise from him not to risk his life in any mad enterprise\nhis accomplice might suggest. But though the Greek’s body seemed almost\nlifeless, so quietly and immovably he rested on his chair, there was a\nrestless look in his eyes that told her how fiercely and irrepressibly\nhis anger burned. She knew enough of his race to know that no power on\nearth could stop him striking for revenge. And she trembled, for\nshe knew also that directly he had begun to strike his madness would\nincrease, and that only sheer physical exhaustion would stay his hand.\n\nMadam Marx was unhappy, and as she waited on her customers her eyes\nrested continually on the Greek, who heeded her not. Once she carried\nsome wine to him, and he drank eagerly, spilling a few drops on the\nfloor first. “It’s like blood,” he muttered, and smiled. Madam hastily\ncovered his mouth with her trembling fingers.\n\nJust before midnight Ahmed arrived with his two friends. Gregorio saw\nthem at once, and, calling them to him, they spoke together in low\nvoices for a few moments. There was little need for words, and soon,\nscarcely noticed by the drinkers and gamblers, they passed out into the\nstreet and walked slowly toward the Jew’s house. Ahmed rapidly repeated\nthe plan of action. When they reached the door they stood for a moment\nbefore they woke the Arab, and these words passed between them:\n\n“For a wife.”\n\n“For a sister.”\n\n“For a son.”\n\nGregorio then demanded admittance and led the way, followed by his three\nfriends. He had visited the house of Amos before, on less bloody but\nless delightful business, and he did not hesitate, but strode on to\nwhere he knew the Jew would be. His companions stood behind the curtain,\nawaiting the signal.\n\nAmos looked somewhat surprised at the Greek’s entrance, but motioned him\nto a seat, and, as on the occasion of his first visit, clapped his hands\ntogether as a signal that coffee and pipes were required.\n\n“It is kind of you to come, for doubtless you wish to pay me what is\nowing.”\n\n“I wish to pay you.”\n\n“That is well. I hope you are better again. I regretted to find you so\nill two nights ago.”\n\n“I am better.”\n\nThe conversation ceased, for Gregorio was restless and his fingers\nitched to do their work. Something in his manner alarmed Amos, for he\nsummoned in two of his servants and raised himself slightly, as if the\nbetter to avoid an attack. But he continued to smoke calmly, watching\nthe Greek under his half-closed lids.\n\n“I have another piece of business to settle with you.”\n\n“Do you want to borrow more money because I refuse to lend you any?”\n\n“No; it is you who have borrowed, and I have come to you to receive back\nmy own.”\n\n“I fail to understand you.”\n\nGregorio tried to keep calm, but it was not possible. Rising to his\nfeet, he bent over the Jew and cried out:\n\n“Give me back my son, you Jew dog!”\n\n“Your son is not here.”\n\n“You lie! by God, you lie! If he is not here you have murdered him.”\n\n“Madman!” shouted Amos, as the Greek’s knife flashed from its sheath;\nbut before he or his servants could stay the uplifted arm the Jew sank\nback among his cushions, wounded to the heart. With a shout of triumph\nand a “Death of all Jews!” Gregorio turned savagely on the servants\nand, reinforced by his companions, soon succeeded in slaying them. Then\nleaving the dead side by side, the four men dashed through the house\nseeking fresh victims. Ten minutes later they were in the street again,\ndripping with the blood of women and men, for in their fury they had\nkilled every human being in the house.\n\nDown the narrow native streets they pushed on quickly, hugging the\nshadows, toward the Penny-farthing Shop. Madam Marx, her ears sharpened\nby fear, heard them, admitted them by a side door, and led them quickly\nto an upper room. Thither she carried water and clean garments, but\ndared not ask any questions. Sick with anxiety, she re-entered the bar\nand waited.\n\nAt length the murderers appeared and called for coffee, and Madam\nMarx attended to their wants. In a few minutes the Egyptians left,\nand Gregorio and she were alone. Coming near him, she placed her hand\ntimidly on his shoulder, and asked him, in a hoarse whisper, to tell her\nwhat had happened.\n\n“My son was not there.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Well, you can guess the rest. Not one person remains alive of that\ndevil’s household.”\n\nMadam Marx gasped at the magnitude of the crime, and though her terrors\nincreased, her pride in the man capable of so tremendous revenge\nincreased also.\n\n“What will happen to you?” she found voice to ask.\n\n“Nothing. I must hide here. We were not seen. Besides, you remember the\nlast time a Greek murdered a Jew--it was at Port Said--the matter was\nhushed up. Our consuls care as little for Jews as we do. My God, how\nglad I am I killed him!”\n\nHis eyes were fixed on the street as he spoke, and suddenly he started\nto his feet. Madam rose too, and clung to him. He pushed her roughly on\none side, while an evil smile played on his lips.\n\n“By God, she shall come back now!”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Xantippe. There is no need for her to live with the Englishman now. Our\nson is dead and the Jew in hell. I will at least have my wife back.”\n\n“She will not come.”\n\n“She will come. By God, I will make her! I have tasted blood to-night,\nand I am not a child to be treated with contempt. I say I will make her\ncome.”\n\n“But if she refuses?”\n\n“Then I will take care she does not go back to the Englishman.”\n\n“You will--” but madam’s voice faltered. Gregorio read her meaning and\nlaughed a yes.\n\n“But, Gregorio, think; you will be hanged for that. You wife is not a\nJewess.”\n\nBut Gregorio laughed again and strode into the street. He was mad with\ngrief and the intoxicating draughts of vengeance he had swallowed. He\nstrode across the road and mounted the stairs with steady feet. Madam\nMarx followed him, weeping and calling on him to come back. As he\nreached the door of his room she flung herself before him, but he\npushed her on one side with his feet and shut the door behind him as he\nentered.\n\nLying on the threshold, she heard the bolt fastened, and knew the last\nact of the tragedy was begun.\n\n\n\n\nXI--HUSBAND AND WIFE\n\nAs Gregorio entered the room, Xantippe, who was kneeling by a box into\nwhich she was placing clothes neatly folded, turned her head and said\nlaughingly:\n\n“You are impatient, my friend; I have nearly--”\n\nBut recognising Gregorio, she did not finish the sentence. She sat down\non the edge of the box. Her face became white, and the blood left her\nlips. With a great effort she remained quiet and folded her hands on her\nlap.\n\nGregorio looked at her for a moment, a cruel smile making his sinister\nface appear almost terrible, and his bloodshot eyes glared at her\nsavagely. At last he broke the silence by shouting her name hoarsely,\nmaking at the same time a movement toward her. He looked like a wild\nanimal about to spring upon his prey. Xantippe, however, did not flinch,\nanswering softly:\n\n“I am not deaf. What do you want here?”\n\n“It is my room; I suppose I have a right to be here.”\n\n“I apologise for having intruded.”\n\n“None of your smooth speeches. The Englishman has schooled you\ncarefully, I see. Can you say ‘good-bye’ in English yet?”\n\n“Why should I say ‘good-bye’?”\n\n“It is time. You will come back to me now.”\n\n“Never.”\n\nGregorio laughed hysterically and stood beside her. His fingers played\nwith her hair. In spite of her fear lest she should irritate him,\nXantippe shrank from his touch. Gregorio noticed her aversion and said\nsavagely:\n\n“You must get used to me, Xantippe. From to-night we live together\nagain. It is not necessary now for you to earn money.”\n\n“I shall not come back to you. I have told you I hate you. It is your\nown fault that I leave you.”\n\n“It will be my fault if you do leave me.”\n\nHe pushed her on to the mattress and held her there.\n\n“Let us talk,” he said.\n\nFor a few minutes there was silence, and then he continued:\n\n“Amos is dead, and our debts are paid.”\n\n“How did you pay them?”\n\n“With this,” and as he spoke he touched the handle of his knife. “Don’t\nshudder; he deserved it, and I shall be safe in a few days. These\naffairs are quickly forgotten. Besides, there is another reason why we\nshould not live as we have lately been living.”\n\nXantippe opened her eyes as she asked, “What reason?”\n\nGregorio relaxed his hold, for the memory of his loss shook him with\nsobs. Cat-like, Xantippe had waited her opportunity and sprang away from\nhis grasp. The movement brought the man to his senses. He rushed at her\nwith an oath, waving the knife in his hand. Xantippe prepared to defend\nherself. They stood, desperate, before each other, neither daring to\nbegin the struggle. Through the awful silence came the sound of sobs and\na plaintive voice crying:\n\n“Gregorio, come back, leave her; I love you.”\n\n“Is Madam Marx outside?” hissed Xantippe.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then go to her. I tell you I hate you.” She pointed to the half-filled\nbox--“I was going to leave here to-night. I will never return to you.”\n\n“You were going with the Englishman?”\n\n“He is a man.”\n\nGregorio paused a moment, then in a suppressed voice, half choking at\nthe words, said:\n\n“Our son--do you know what has happened to him? You shall not leave me.”\n\n“I know about our son. I am glad to think he is away from your evil\ninfluence. Let me pass.” Xantippe moved toward the door, but Gregorio\nseized her by the throat.\n\n“You are glad our son is killed; you helped Amos to kill him.”\n\nRage and despair impelled him. Laughing brutally, he struck her on the\nbreast, and, as he tottered, sent his knife deep into her heart. For a\nfew seconds he stood over her exulting, and then opened the door. Madam\nMarx, white with fear, rushed into the room. Seeing the murdered woman,\na look of triumph came into her eyes. But it was a momentary triumph,\nfor she realised at once the gravity of the crime. She had little pity\nor sorrow to waste on the dead, but she was full of concern for the\nsafety of the murderer.\n\n“This is a bad night’s work, Gregorio.”\n\n“Is it? She deserved death. I am glad I killed her. God, how peacefully\nI shall sleep tonight!”\n\n“This is a worse matter than the other, my friend; you must get away\nfrom here at once.”\n\n“Let us leave the corpse; I am thirsty,” Gregorio answered, callously.\nWith a last look at Xantippe dead upon the floor, the two left the room\nand made fast the bolt before descending the stairs. As they emerged\nfrom the doorway into the street, some police rode by, and Gregorio\ntrembled a little as he stood watching them.\n\n“I want a drink; I am trembling,” he said, huskily, and followed Madam\nMarx into the shop.\n\nThe sun was beginning to rise, and already signs of a new life were\nstirring. The day-workers appeared at the windows and in the streets.\n\n“You must get away at night, Gregorio, and keep hidden all day.”\n\n“All right. Give me some wine. I can arrange better when my thirst is\nsatisfied.”\n\nAfter drinking deeply he turned and laughed. “It has been a busy time\nsince sunset.”\n\nThen, as if a new idea suddenly struck him, he queried cunningly, “There\nwill be a reward offered?”\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\n“Then you will be a rich woman.”\n\nMadam Marx flung herself at his feet and wept bitterly. The blow was a\ncruel one indeed. Eagerly she entreated him to retract his words. She\nreminded him of all she had done for him, of all she would still do. A\nsort of eloquence came to her as she pleaded her cause, and Gregorio,\nweary with excitement, kissed her as he asked:\n\n“But why should you not give me up?”\n\n“Because I love you.”\n\nNeither blood nor cruelty could stain him in her eyes.\n\nAt last her passion spent itself; calmed and soothed by Gregorio’s\ncaress she realised again the danger her lover ran. Vainly were plans\ndiscussed; no fair chance of escape seemed open. At last Gregorio said:\n\n“I shall leave here to-night for Ramleh and live in the desert for a\ntime. If you help me we can manage easily. When my beard is grown I can\nget back here safely enough, and the matter will be forgotten. You must\ncollect food and take it by train to the last station, and get the box\nburied by Ahmed near the palace. I can creep toward it at night unseen.”\n\n“But I will come to you at night and bring food and drink.”\n\n“No. That would only attract attention. You must not leave your\ncustomers. But the drink is the worst part of the matter. I must have\nwater. Get as many ostrich-eggs as you can, and fill them with water,\nand seal them. Hide these with the food, and I will carry some of them\ninto the farther desert and bury them there.”\n\n“Gregorio, if all comes right you will not be sorry you killed her?”\n\n“She hated me. I shall not be sorry.”\n\nAnd Madam Marx smiled and forgot her fears.\n\n\n\n\nXII--IN THE DESERT AND ON THE SEA\n\nBy the last train leaving Alexandria for Ramleh, the next evening,\nGregorio sought to escape his pursuers. He had heard from Ahmed on\nthe platform, just before starting, that Xantippe’s body had been\ndiscovered, and that already the police were on his track. He sat in\na corner of a third-class carriage closely muffled, and eyeing his\nneighbours suspiciously. He sighed with relief as the train moved out\nof the station and began to pass by the sand-hills and white villas,\nshowing ghost-like in the damp mist.\n\nWhen he reached St. Antonio he saw the lights of the casino blazing\ncheerfully, and the pure clear desert air invigorated him. Fascinated\nby the glare, he strolled toward the casino and decided, in spite of\nthe risk, to enter. He watched from a corner the players, and greedily\ncoveted the masses of gold and silver piled in pyramids behind the\ncroupiers. He heard the violins playing Suppe’s overture, and the\nremembrance came vividly to him of the Paradiso and the fair girl with\nwhom the Englishman talked. The exciting events following that evening\npassed before him--a lurid panorama.\n\nAn hour fled quickly away; then he sought the solitude of the desert,\nand, having collected into a bag as much food and as many eggs as he\ncould carry, he walked away over the sands.\n\nUnder the stars he dug holes wherein to bury the eggs, and marked the\nspots with stones; then, wrapping himself in his cloak, lay down to\nsleep. All next day he loitered idly about, shunning the gaze of every\nwandering Arab. When evening came he drew near to the palace to seek for\nfood. To his horror, the box had not been refilled. At first he hardly\nrealised how awful was his plight. Then the truth dawned upon him. Ahmed\nand Madam Marx must have been arrested. He drew near to the casino and\nstood under the open windows listening. A cold shudder ran down his\nback, his face grew pale, and his lips trembled, for he heard two men\ndiscussing the murder and the capture of his friends. An involuntary\nsmile lighted up the gloom of his features for a moment as one remarked\nthat the chief offender, the woman’s husband, had eluded pursuit. Then\nhe crept back into the desert and waited for the dawn.\n\nThe sun rose, fiery and relentless, glittering on the waters of Aboukir,\nand the cloudless heaven blazed like a prairie on fire. At midday, when\nits rays fell straight upon him, his thirst became intense, and with\nfeverish fingers he dug up an egg. It was empty. He tossed it away and\ndragged himself to another hole. The second egg was empty. In turn\nhe dug up all his eggs, and all alike were empty. Improperly sealed,\nscantily covered by the sand, the water had evaporated. A great despair\nseized him; he called on God in his anguish, and the silence of the\ndesert terrified him. In a fit of desolate anger he pulled off his cap,\nand summoned all the saints, Christ, and God Himself, to enter it, and\nthen trampled on it, laughing wildly. Then he flung himself upon the\nsand, his head still left bare to the pitiless sun. He knew the end had\ncome, but there was not any regret in his heart for his crimes, only\nan impotent dismay and anger at his solitary condition. The thirst\nincreased every minute, and he gripped the sand with his fingers in his\nagony. His last word was an oath.\n\nAt sunset he was dead.\n\nTwo days later Madam Marx left Alexandria by train for Ramleh. There was\nno evidence against her, and she had soon been released. Her own trouble\nscarcely disconcerted her; she had feared only for the Greek in the\ndesert. The thought of his agony, his hunger, goaded her nearly to\nmadness; but she was a little comforted when she remembered the eggs.\nThere was enough water in them to last him two or three days. It was the\nhour of sunset when she arrived, and she instantly set out desertward,\ncarrying a basket containing wine and food. She had determined to live\nat the hotel until the days of persecution were past. The heavy sand\nmade it hard to proceed rapidly, but she struggled on bravely, and when\nfar enough from civilisation called aloud the signal-word agreed on.\nBut no one answered. All through the night she wandered, searching,\ntill within an hour of sunrise; then she gave way and sat weeping on the\nsand. With daylight she rose to her feet, determined to find her lover,\nbut had scarcely gone twenty yards before, with a low cry of grief, she\nknelt beside the body of a dead man. In the half-eaten, decayed features\nshe recognised Gregorio and knew she had come too late. Undeterred by\nthe hideous spectacle, she kissed him tenderly and lay beside him.\n\nThe sun mounted slowly in the heavens.\n\nThe living figure lay as lifeless as the dead. But after a while the\nwoman rose and dug with her hands a hollow in the sand. She heeded not\nthe heat, nor the flight of time, and by evening her work was done.\n\nRaising the body in her arms, she carried it to the hollow and laid it\ngently down, then tearfully shovelled back the sand till it was hidden.\nSo Gregorio found a tomb. Nor did it remain unconsecrated, for beside\nit Madam Marx knelt and spoke with faltering lips the remnants of the\nprayers she had learned when a child. As she prayed she watched vaguely\na steamer disappear behind the horizon.\n\n\nThe khedival mail-boat _Ramses_ sped swiftly over the unruffled surface\nof the sea. At the stern a tall fair Englishman sat looking on the level\nshores of Egypt and the minarets of Alexandria. With a sad smile he\nturned to the child who called to him by his name. They were a strange\npair, for the boy was dark, and foreign-looking, and there was something\nof cunning in his restless black eyes. The man’s large hand rested\nsoftly on the raven curls of the youngster as he muttered to himself:\n\n“For her sake I will watch over you, and you shall grow up to be a true\nman.”\n\nSo Xantippe’s life had not been lived in vain, for she had loved and\nbeen loved, and her memory was sweet to her lover. Moreover, Gregorio’s\ndreams of wealth for his son were to find fulfilment, and the sand of\nthe desert, maybe, lies lightly on him.\n'),(8,'KING BEMBA’S POINT, A WEST AFRICAN STORY, By J. Landers\n\n\nWe were for the most part a queer lot out on that desolate southwest\nAfrican coast, in charge of the various trading stations that were\nscattered along the coast, from the Gaboon River, past the mouth of the\nmighty Congo, to the Portuguese city of St. Paul de Loanda. A mixture of\nall sorts, especially bad sorts: broken-down clerks, men who could not\nsucceed anywhere else, sailors, youths, and some whose characters would\nnot have borne any investigation; and we very nearly all drank hard, and\nthose who didn’t drink hard took more than was good for them.\n\nI don’t know exactly what induced me to go out there. I was young\nfor one thing, the country was unknown, the berth was vacant, and the\nconditions of it easy.\n\nImagine a high rocky point or headland, stretching out sideways into\nthe sea, and at its base a small river winding into a country that\nwas seemingly a blank in regard to inhabitants or cultivation; a land\ncontinuing for miles and miles, as far as the eye could see, one expanse\nof long yellow grass, dotted here and there with groups of bastard\npalms. In front of the headland rolled the lonely South Atlantic; and,\nas if such conditions were not dispiriting enough to existence upon the\nPoint, there was yet another feature which at times gave the place a\nstill more ghastly look. A long way off the shore, the heaving surface\nof the ocean began, in anything like bad weather, to break upon the\nshoals of the coast. Viewed from the top of the rock, the sea at such\ntimes looked, for at least two miles out, as if it were scored over with\nlines of white foam; but lower down, near the beach, each roller could\nbe distinctly seen, and each roller had a curve of many feet, and was an\nenormous mass of water that hurled itself shoreward until it curled and\nbroke.\n\nWhen I first arrived on the Point there was, I may say, only one house\nupon it, and that belonged to Messrs. Flint Brothers, of Liverpool. It\nwas occupied by one solitary man named Jackson; he had had an assistant,\nbut the assistant had died of fever, and I was sent to replace him.\nJackson was a man of fifty at least, who had been a sailor before he\nhad become an African trader. His face bore testimony to the winds\nand weather it had encountered, and wore habitually a grave, if not\nmelancholy, expression. He was rough but kind to me, and though strict\nwas just, which was no common feature in an old African hand to one who\nhad just arrived on the coast.\n\nHe kept the factory--we called all houses on the coast factories--as\nneat and clean as if it had been a ship. He had the floor of the portion\nwe dwelt in holystoned every week; and numberless little racks and\nshelves were fitted up all over the house. The outside walls glittered\nwith paint, and the yard was swept clean every morning; and every\nSunday, at eight o’clock and sunset, the ensign was hoisted and lowered,\nand an old cannon fired at the word of command. Order and rule were with\nJackson observed from habit, and were strictly enforced by him on all\nthe natives employed in the factory.\n\nAlthough I have said the country looked as if uninhabited, there were\nnumerous villages hidden away in the long grass and brushwood, invisible\nat a distance, being huts of thatch or mud, and not so high as the\ngrass among which they were placed. From these villages came most of our\nservants, and also the middlemen, who acted as brokers between us, the\nwhite men, and the negroes who brought ivory and gum and india-rubber\nfrom the far interior for sale. Our trade was principally in ivory,\nand when an unusually large number of elephants’ tusks arrived upon the\nPoint for sale, it would be crowded with Bushmen, strange and uncouth,\nand hideously ugly, and armed, and then we would be very busy; for\nsometimes as many as two hundred tusks would be brought to us at the\nsame time, and each of these had to be bargained for and paid for by\nexchange of cotton cloths, guns, knives, powder, and a host of small\nwares.\n\nFor some time after my arrival our factory, along with the others on\nthe coast belonging to Messrs. Flint Brothers, was very well supplied\nby them with goods for the trade; but by degrees their shipments became\nless frequent, and small when they did come. In spite of repeated\nletters we could gain no reason from the firm for this fact, nor could\nthe other factories, and gradually we found ourselves with an empty\nstorehouse, and nearly all our goods gone. Then followed a weary\ninterval, during which we had nothing whatever to do, and day succeeded\nday through the long hot season. It was now that I began to feel that\nJackson had become of late more silent and reserved with me than ever\nhe had been. I noticed, too, that he had contracted a habit of wandering\nout to the extreme end of the Point, where he would sit for hours gazing\nupon the ocean before him. In addition to this, he grew morose and\nuncertain in his temper toward the natives, and sometimes he would fall\nasleep in the evenings on a sofa, and talk to himself at such a rate\nwhile asleep that I would grow frightened and wake him, when he would\nstare about him for a little until he gathered consciousness, and then\nhe would stagger off to bed to fall asleep again almost immediately.\nAlso, his hands trembled much, and he began to lose flesh. All this\ntroubled me, for his own sake as well as my own, and I resolved to ask\nhim to see the doctor of the next mail-steamer that came. With this\nidea I went one day to the end of the Point, and found him in his usual\nattitude, seated on the long grass, looking seaward. He did not hear me\napproach, and when I spoke he started to his feet, and demanded fiercely\nwhy I disturbed him. I replied, as mildly as I could, for I was rather\nafraid of the glittering look that was in his eyes, that I wished to ask\nhim if he did not feel ill.\n\nHe regarded me with a steady but softened glance for a little, and then\nsaid:\n\n“My lad, I thank you for your trouble; but I want no doctor. Do you\nthink I’m looking ill?”\n\n“Indeed you are,” I answered, “ill and thin; and, do you know, I hear\nyou talk to yourself in your sleep nearly every night.”\n\n“What do I say?” he asked eagerly.\n\n“That I cannot tell,” I replied. “It is all rambling talk; the same\nthings over and over again, and nearly all about one person--Lucy.”\n\n“Boy!” he cried out, as if in pain, or as if something had touched him\nto the quick, “sit you down, and I’ll tell you why I think of her--she\nwas my wife.”\n\nHe moved nearer to the edge of the cliff, and we sat down, almost over\nthe restless sea beneath us.\n\n“She lives in my memory,” he continued, speaking more to himself than\nto me, and looking far out to the horizon, beneath which the setting\nsun had begun to sink, “in spite of all I can do or think of to make\nher appear base in my eyes. For she left me to go with another man--a\nscoundrel. This was how it was,” he added, quickly: “I married her, and\nthought her as pure as a flower; but I could not take her to sea with\nme because I was only the mate of a vessel, so I left her among her\nown friends, in the village where she was born. In a little cottage by\nherself I settled her, comfortable and happy as I thought. God! how\nshe hung round my neck and sobbed when I went away the first time!\nand yet--yet--within a year she left me.” And he stopped for several\nminutes, resting his head upon his hands. “At first I could get no trace\nof her,” he resumed. “Her friends knew nothing more of her than that\nshe had left the village suddenly. Gradually I found out the name of the\nscoundrel who had seduced her away. He had bribed her friends so that\nthey were silent; but I overbribed them with the last money I had, and\nI followed him and my wife on foot. I never found them, nor did I ever\nknow why she had deserted me for him. If I had only known the reason; if\nI could have been told of my fault; if she had only written to say that\nshe was tired of me; that I was too old, too rough for her soft ways,--I\nthink I could have borne the heavy stroke the villain had dealt me\nbetter. The end of my search was that I dropped down in the streets of\nLiverpool, whither I thought I had tracked them, and was carried to\nthe hospital with brain-fever upon me. Two months afterward I came out\ncured, and the sense of my loss was deadened within me, so that I\ncould go to sea again, which I did, before the mast, under the name of\nJackson, in a bark that traded to this coast here.” And the old sailor\nrose to his feet and turned abruptly away, leaving me sitting alone.\n\nI saw that he did not wish to be followed, so I stayed where I was and\nwatched the gray twilight creep over the face of the sea, and the night\nquickly succeed to it. Not a cloud had been in the sky all day long, and\nas the darkness increased the stars came out, until the whole heavens\nwere studded with glittering gems.\n\nSuddenly, low down, close to the sea, a point of light flickered and\ndisappeared, shone again for a moment, wavered and went out, only to\nreappear and shine steadily. “A steamer’s masthead light,” I thought,\nand ran to the house to give the news; but Jackson had already seen\nthe light, and pronounced that she had anchored until the morning. At\ndaybreak there she was, dipping her sides to the swell of the sea as\nit rolled beneath her. It was my duty to go off to her in one of the\nsurf-boats belonging to the factory; and so I scrambled down the cliff\nto the little strip of smooth beach that served us for a landing-place.\n\nWhen I arrived there I found that the white-crested breakers were\nheavier than I had thought they would be. However, there was the boat\nlying on the beach with its prow toward the waves, and round it were the\nboat-boys with their loincloths girded, ready to start; so I clambered\ninto the stern, or rather--for the boat was shaped alike at stem and\nstern--the end from which the steersman, or _patrao_, used his long oar.\nWith a shout the boys laid hold of the sides of the boat, and the next\nmoment it was dancing on the spent waves next to the beach. The patrao\nkept its head steady, and the boys jumped in and seized the oars, and\nbegan pulling with a will, standing up to their stroke. Slowly the\nheavy craft gathered way, and approached a dark and unbroken roller that\nhastened toward the beach. Then the patrao shouted to the crew, and they\nlay on their oars, and the wave with a roar burst right in front of the\nboat, sending the spray of its crest high above our heads.\n\n“_Rema! rema forca!_” (“Row strongly!”) now shouted the patrao, speaking\nPortuguese, as mostly all African coast natives do; and the crew gave\nway. The next roller we had to meet in its strength; and save for the\nsteady force of the patrao’s oar, I believe it would have tossed us\naside and we would have been swept under its curving wall of water. As\nit was, the good boat gave a mighty bound as it felt its force, and its\nstem pitched high into the air as it slid down its broad back into the\ndeep.\n\nAnother and yet another wave were passed, and we could now see them\nbreaking behind us, shutting out the beach from view. Then the last\nroller was overcome, and there was nothing but the long heave of the\ndeep sea to contend against. Presently we arrived at the steamer, whose\nside towered above us--an iron wall.\n\nA shout came to me, pitching and lurching with the boat far below, “Come\non board at once.” But to come on board was only to be done by watching\na chance as the boat rose on the top of a roller. Taking such a one, I\nseized the side-ropes, swung a moment in mid-air, and the next was on\nthe streamer’s clean white deck. Before me stood a tall man with black\nhair and whiskers and dark piercing eyes, who asked me if I was the\nagent for Flint Brothers. I answered that the agent was on shore, and\nthat I was his assistant. Whereupon he informed me that he had been\nappointed by the firm to liquidate all their stations and businesses on\nthe coast, and “he would be obliged by my getting his luggage into the\nboat.” This was said in a peremptory sort of way, as if he had spoken to\na servant; and very much against the grain I obeyed his orders.\n\nThat the man was new to the coast was evident, and my consolation was\nthat he would be very soon sick of it and pretty well frightened before\nhe even got on shore, for the weather was freshening rapidly, a fact\nof which he appeared to take no heed. Not so the boat-boys, who were\nanxious to be off. At last we started, and I soon had my revenge. As\nwe drew near the shore the rollers became higher and higher, and I\nperceived that my gentleman clutched the gunwale of the boat very\ntightly, and when the first wave that showed signs of breaking overtook\nus, he grew very white in the face until it had passed.\n\nThe next one or two breakers were small, much to his relief I could see,\nthough he said nothing. Before he had well recovered his equanimity,\nhowever, a tremendous wave approached us somewhat suddenly. Appalled by\nits threatening aspect, he sprang from his seat and seized the arm of\nthe patrao, who roughly shook him off.\n\n“My God!” he cried, “we are swamped!” and for the moment it really\nlooked like it; but the patrao, with a dexterous sweep of his long oar,\nturned the boat’s head toward the roller. It broke just as it reached\nus, and gave us the benefit of its crest, which came in over the\ntopsides of the boat as it passed by, and deluged every one of us.\n\nI laughed, although it was no laughing matter, at the plight the\nliquidator was now in. He was changed in a moment from the spruce and\nnatty personage into a miserable and draggled being. From every part of\nhim the salt water was streaming, and the curl was completely taken out\nof his whiskers. He could not speak from terror, which the boat-boys\nsoon saw, for none are quicker than negroes to detect signs of fear\nin those whom they are accustomed to consider superior to themselves.\nFamiliar with the surf, and full of mischievous fun, they began to shout\nand gesticulate with the settled purpose of making matters appear worse\nthan they were, and of enjoying the white man’s discomfiture,--all but\nthe patrao, who was an old hand, and on whom depended the safety of\nus all. He kept a steady lookout seaward, and stood upright and firm,\ngrasping his oar with both hands. With him it was a point of honour to\nbring the white men intrusted to his care safely through the surf.\n\nWe waited for more than half an hour, bow on, meeting each roller as it\ncame to us; and by the end of that time the unfortunate liquidator had\nevidently given up all hope of ever reaching the shore. Luckily, the\nworst was soon to pass. After one last tremendous wave there was a lull\nfor a few moments, and the patrao, who had watched for such a chance,\nswiftly turned the boat round, and giving the word to the crew, they\npulled lustily toward the shore. In a few minutes we were again in\nsafety. The boat grounded on the beach, the oars were tossed into the\nsea; the crew sprang overboard; some of them seized the new arrival; I\nclambered on the back of the patrao; a crowd of negroes, who had been\nwaiting on the beach, laid hold of the tow-rope of the boat, and it and\nwe were landed simultaneously on the dry sand.\n\nOnce on shore Mr. Bransome, for that was the new man’s name, rapidly\nrecovered his presence of mind and manner, and, by way of covering his\npast confusion, remarked that he supposed the surf was seldom so bad as\nit then was. I replied in an offhand way, meaning to make fun of him,\nthat what he had passed through was nothing, and appealed to the patrao\nto confirm what I had said. That negro, seeing the joke, grinned all\nover his black face; and Mr. Bransome, perceiving that he was being\nlaughed at, snatched a good-sized stick from a native standing near, and\nstruck the patrao repeatedly over the back.\n\nIn vain Sooka, for that was the patrao’s name, protested, and demanded\nto know what wrong thing he had done. The agent was furious, and\nshowered his blows upon the black. Equally in vain I shouted that Sooka\nhad done well by us, and that he, Mr. Bransome, was making an enemy of\na man who would have him now and then in his power. At length Sooka\ntook to his heels, and sure enough, when he had got a little way off, he\nbegan to threaten vengeance for what he had received. I sympathised with\nhim, for I knew what a loss to his dignity it was to be beaten without\ncause before his fellows, and I feared that Mr. Bransome would indeed be\nsorry, sooner or later, for what he had done.\n\nI now suggested to him, by way of diverting his thoughts from poor\nSooka, that standing on the beach in wet clothes was the very way to\ncatch the coast-fever straight off, and he instantly suffered himself to\nbe carried up the factory. There Jackson received him in a sort of\n“who on earth are you?” manner; and Mr. Bransome, clearing his throat,\nannounced himself and his authority, adding that he intended to make the\nfactory a point of departure to all the others on the coast; then,\nvery abruptly, he requested Jackson to prepare quarters for him without\ndelay.\n\nThe change that came over Jackson’s face as he learned the quality of\nthe stranger and his requests was great. The old salt, who had been king\nof his house and of the Point for so long a time, had evidently\nnever even thought of the probability of such an intrusion as was now\npresented to him, and he was amazed at what he considered to be the\nunwarrantable assurance of the stranger. However, he recovered himself\nsmartly, and asked the new man if he had any written credentials.\n\n“Certainly,” replied he, pulling out a document all wet with salt water.\n“Here is a letter from Messrs. Flint Brothers, of which, no doubt, you\nwill have a copy in your mail-bag.”\n\nJackson took the letter and opened it, and seemed to read it slowly to\nhimself. All at once he started, looked at the new agent, advanced a\nstep or two toward him, muttering, “Bransome, Bransome,” then stopped\nand asked him in a strange constrained voice, “Is _your_ name Bransome?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the latter, astonished at the old man’s question.\n\n“I knew a Bransome once,” said Jackson, steadily, “and he was a\nscoundrel.”\n\nFor a moment the two men looked at each other--Jackson with a gleam of\nhatred in his eyes, while Bransome had a curiously frightened expression\non his face, which blanched slightly. But he quickly resumed his\ncomposure and peremptory way, and said, “Show me a room; I must get\nthese wet things off me.”\n\nAs, however, he addressed himself this time to me rather than to\nJackson,--who, indeed, regarded him no longer, but stood with the letter\nloose in his hand, looking at the floor of the room, as if in deep\nmeditation,--I showed him into my own room, where I ordered his trunks\nto be brought. These, of course, were wet; but he found some things in\nthe middle of them that were not more than slightly damp, and with the\nhelp of a pair of old canvas trousers of mine he managed to make his\nappearance at dinner-time.\n\nJackson was not at the meal. He had left the house shortly after his\ninterview with the new agent, and had, I fancied, gone on one of his\nsolitary rambles. At any rate he did not return until late that night.\n\nI thought Mr. Bransome seemed to be somewhat relieved when he saw\nthat the old man was not coming; and he became more affable than I had\nexpected him to be, and relinquished his arrogant style altogether when\nhe began to question me about Jackson--who he was? what had he been?\nhow long he had lived on the coast? To all which questions I returned\ncautious answers, remembering that I was under a promise to the old man\nnot to repeat his story.\n\nBy the next morning, to my surprise, Jackson appeared to have become\nreconciled to the fact that he had been superseded by a man who knew\nnothing of the coast, and of his own accord he offered to tell Mr.\nBransome the clues to the letter-locks on the doors of the various\nstore-rooms; for we on the coast used none but letter-locks, which\nare locks that do not require a key to open them. But Mr. Bransome\nexpressed, most politely, a wish that Jackson should consider himself\nstill in charge of the factory, at any rate until the whole estate of\nthe unfortunate Flint Brothers could be wound up; and he trusted that\nhis presence would make no difference to him.\n\nThis was a change, on the part of both men, from the manners of the\nprevious day; and yet I could not help thinking that each but ill\nconcealed his aversion to the other.\n\nMonths now slipped away, and Mr. Bransome was occupied in going up and\ndown the coast in a little steamer, shutting up factory after factory,\ntransferring their goods to ours, and getting himself much disliked by\nall the Europeans under him, and hated by the natives, especially by\nthe boat-boys, who were a race or tribe by themselves, coming from one\nparticular part of the coast. He had, of course, been obliged to order\nthe dismissal of many of them, and this was one reason why they hated\nhim; but the chief cause was his treatment of Sooka, the patrao. That\nman never forgave Mr. Bransome for beating him so unjustly; and the\nnews of the deed had travelled very quickly, as news does in savage\ncountries, so that I think nearly all of Sooka’s countrymen knew of the\nact and resented it.\n\nMr. Bransome was quite unaware of the antipathy he had thus created\ntoward himself, except so far as Sooka was concerned; and him he never\nemployed when he had to go off to vessels or land from them, but always\nwent in the other boat belonging to the factory, which was steered by a\nmuch younger negro. In addition to humbling Sooka in this way, Bransome\ntook the opportunity of disgracing him whenever he could do so.\nTherefore, one day when two pieces of cloth from the cargo-room were\nfound in the boatmen’s huts, it was no surprise to me that Sooka was at\nonce fastened upon by Mr. Bransome as the thief who had stolen them,\nand that he was tied to the flogging-post in the middle of the yard, and\nsentenced to receive fifty lashes with the cat that was kept for such\na purpose, and all without any inquiry being made. In vain did the\nunfortunate man protest his innocence. A swarthy Kroot-boy from Cape\nCoast laid the cat on his brown shoulders right willingly, for he also\nwas an enemy of Sooka’s; and in a few minutes the poor fellow’s flesh\nwas cut and scored as if by a knife.\n\nAfter the flogging was over Mr. Bransome amused himself by getting out\nhis rifle and firing fancy shots at Sooka, still tied to the post; that\nis, he tried to put the bullets as close to the poor wretch as he could\nwithout actually wounding him. To a negro, with his dread of firearms,\nthis was little short of absolute torture, and at each discharge Sooka\nwrithed and crouched as close to the ground as he could, while his\nwide-opened eyes and mouth, and face of almost a slate colour, showed\nhow terribly frightened he was. To Mr. Bransome it appeared to be\nfine sport, for he fired at least twenty shots at the man before he\nshouldered his rifle and went indoors. Jackson said nothing to this\nstupid exhibition of temper, but as soon as it was over he had Sooka\nreleased; and I knew he attended to his wounds himself, and poured\nfriar’s balsam into them, and covered his back with a soft shirt--for\nall which, no doubt, the negro was afterward grateful. Whether Mr.\nBransome got to know of this, and was offended at it, I do not know, but\nshortly afterward he ceased to live with us.\n\nThere was between the factory and the sea, and a little to the right of\nthe former, a small wooden cottage which had been allowed to fall into a\ndilapidated state from want of some one to live in it. This Mr. Bransome\ngave orders to the native carpenters to repair and make weather-tight;\nand when they had done so, he caused a quantity of furniture to be\nbrought from St. Paul de Loanda and placed within in it. Then he\ntransferred himself and his baggage to the cottage.\n\nJackson displayed complete indifference to this change on the part of\nthe agent. In fact, there had been, ever since the arrival of the latter\nupon the Point, and in spite of apparent friendliness, a perceptible\nbreach, widening daily, between the two men. As to the reason of this I\nhad my own suspicions, for I had made the discovery that Jackson had for\nsome time past been drinking very heavily.\n\nIn addition to the brandy which we white men had for our own use, I had,\nto my horror, found out that he was secretly drinking the coarse\nand fiery rum that was sold to the natives; and as I remembered the\nmutterings and moanings that had formerly alarmed me, I wondered that I\nhad not guessed the cause of them at the time; but until the arrival of\nMr. Bransome, Jackson had always kept charge of the spirits himself, and\nhe was such a secret old fellow that there was no knowing what he had\nthen taken. Now that I was aware of his failing, I was very sorry for\nthe old sailor; for on such a coast and in such a climate there was only\none end to it; and although I could not actually prevent him from taking\nthe liquor, I resolved to watch him, and if such symptoms as I had seen\nbefore again appeared, to tell Mr. Bransome of them at all hazards. But\nI was too late to prevent what speedily followed my discovery. It had\ncome about that the same mail-steamer that had brought out Mr. Bransome\nhad again anchored off the Point, and again the weather was coarse and\nlowering. A stiff breeze had blown for some days, which made the rollers\nworse than they had been for a long while. Both Mr. Bransome and Jackson\nwatched the weather with eager looks, but each was differently affected\nby it. Bransome appeared to be anxious and nervous, while Jackson was\nexcited, and paced up and down the veranda, and kept, strange to say,\nfor it was contrary to his late habit, a watch upon Bransome’s every\nmovement.\n\nEvery now and then, too, he would rub his hands together as if in eager\nexpectation, and would chuckle to himself as he glanced seaward. Of his\nown accord he gave orders to Sooka to get both the surf-boats ready for\nlaunching, and to make the boys put on their newest loin-cloths; and\nthen, when everything was in readiness, he asked Bransome if he was\ngoing off to the steamer.\n\n“I fear I must,” said Bransome; “but I--I don’t like the look of those\ncursed rollers.”\n\nAt this Jackson laughed, and said something about “being afraid of very\nlittle.”\n\n“The beach is perfectly good,” he added; “Sooka knows, and Sooka is the\noldest patrao on the Point.”\n\nAnd Sooka, who was standing by, made a low obeisance to the agent, and\nsaid that “the beach lived for well,” which was his way of expressing in\nEnglish that the sea was not heavy.\n\nAt that moment a gun was fired from the steamer as a signal to be quick,\nand Bransome said, “I will go, but not in that black blackguard’s boat;\nit need not come,” and he went down to the beach.\n\nIt was one of Jackson’s rules that when a boat went through the surf\nthere should be some one to watch it, so I walked to the end of the\nPoint to see the agent put off. He got away safely; and I, seeing\nSooka’s boat lying on the beach, and thinking that it would be as well\nto have it hauled up under the boat-shed, was on the point of returning\nto the factory to give the necessary order, when, to my surprise, I saw\nthe boat’s crew rush down the beach to the boat and begin to push it\ntoward the sea.\n\nI waved my arms as a signal to them to stop, but they paid no attention\nto me; and I saw them run the boat into the water, jump into her, and\npull off, all singing a song to their stroke in their own language,\nthe sound of which came faintly up to the top of the Point. “Stupid\nfellows!” I muttered to myself, “they might have known that the boat\nwas not wanted;” and I was again about to turn away, when I was suddenly\nseized from behind, and carried to the very edge of the cliff, and then\nas suddenly released.\n\nI sprang to one side, and turning round saw Jackson, with a look of such\nsavage fury on his face that I retreated a step or two in astonishment\nat him. He perceived my alarm, and burst out into a fit of laughter,\nwhich, instead of reassuring me, had the opposite effect, it was\nso demoniacal in character. “Ha! ha!” he laughed again, “are you\nfrightened?” and advancing toward me, he put his face close to mine,\npeering into it with bloodshot eyes, while his breath, reeking of\nspirits, poured into my nostrils.\n\nInvoluntarily I put up my arm to keep him off. He clutched it, and,\npointing with his other hand to the sea, whispered hoarsely, “What do\nyou hear of the surf? Will the breakers be heavier before sundown? See\nhow they begin to curve! Listen how they already thunder, thunder,\non the beach! I tell you they are impatient--they seek some one,” he\nshouted. “Do you know,” he continued, lowering his voice again, and\nspeaking almost confidentially, “sooner or later some one is drowned\nupon that bar?” And even as he spoke a fresh line of breakers arose from\nthe deep, farther out than any had been before. This much I observed,\nbut I was too greatly unnerved by the strange manner of Jackson to pay\nfurther heed to the sea. It had flashed across my mind that he was on\nthe verge of an attack of delirium tremens, from the effects of the\nliquor he had been consuming for so long, and the problem was to get him\nback to the house quietly.\n\nSuddenly a thought struck me. Putting my arm within his, I said,\nas coolly as I could, “Never mind the sea, Jackson; let us have a\n_matabicho_” (our local expression for a “drink”). He took the bait, and\ncame away quietly enough to the house. Once there, I enticed him into\nthe dining-room, and shutting to the door quickly, I locked it on the\noutside, resolving to keep him there until Mr. Bransome should return;\nfor, being alone, I was afraid of him.\n\nThen I went back to the end of the Point to look for the return of the\ntwo boats. When I reached it I saw that the rollers had increased\nin size in the short time that I had been absent, and that they were\nbreaking, one after another, as fast as they could come shoreward; not\npygmy waves, but great walls of water along their huge length before\nthey fell.\n\nA surf such as I had never yet seen had arisen. I stood and anxiously\nwatched through a glass the boats at the steamer’s side, and at length,\nto my relief, I saw one of them leave her, but as it came near I saw, to\nmy surprise, that Mr. Bransome was not in the boat, and that it was not\nthe one that Sooka steered. Quickly it was overtaken by the breakers,\nbut escaped their power, and came inshore on the back of a majestic\nroller that did not break until it was close to the beach, where the\nboat was in safety.\n\nNot without vague apprehension at his imprudence, but still not\nanticipating any actual harm from it, I thought that Mr. Bransome had\nchosen to come back in Sooka’s boat, and I waited and waited to see _it_\nreturn, although the daylight had now so waned that I could no longer\ndistinguish what was going on alongside the steamer. At last I caught\nsight of the boat, a white speck upon the waters, and, just as it\nentered upon the dangerous part of the bar, I discerned to my infinite\namazement, that two figures were seated in the stern--a man and a\nwoman--a white woman; I could see her dress fluttering in the wind, and\nSooka’s black figure standing behind her.\n\nOn came the boat, impelled by the swift-flowing seas, for a quarter of\nan hour it was tossed on the crests of the waves. Again and again it\nrose and sank with them as they came rolling in, but somehow, after\na little further time, it seemed to me that it did not make such way\ntoward the shore as it should have done.\n\nI lifted the glass to my eyes, and I saw that the boys were hardly\npulling at all, though the boat was not close to the rocks that were\nnear the cliff. Nor did Sooka seem to be conscious of a huge roller that\nwas swiftly approaching him. In my excitement I was just on the point of\nshouting to warn those in the boat of their danger, although I knew that\nthey could not understand what I might say, when I saw Jackson standing\non the edge of the cliff, a little way off, dressed in his shirt and\ntrousers only. He had escaped from the house! He perceived that I saw\nhim, and came running up on me, and I threw myself on my guard. However,\nhe did not attempt to touch me, but stopped and cried:\n\n“Did I not tell you that somebody would be drowned by those waves? Watch\nthat boat! watch it! it is doomed; and the scoundrel, the villain, who\nis in it will never reach the shore alive!” and he hissed the last word\nthrough his clenched teeth.\n\n“Good God, Jackson!” I said, “don’t say that! Look, there is a white\nwoman in the boat!”\n\nAt the words his jaw dropped, his form, which a moment before had swayed\nwith excitement, became rigid, and his eyes stared at me as if he knew,\nbut comprehended not, what I had said. Then he slowly turned his face\ntoward the sea, and, as he did so, the mighty breaker that had been\ncoming up astern of the boat curled over it. For a moment or two it\nrushed forward, a solid body of water, carrying the boat with it; and\nin those moments I saw, to my horror, Sooka give one sweep with his oar,\nwhich threw the boat’s side toward the roller. I saw the boat-boys leap\nclear of the boat into the surf; I saw the agonised faces of the man and\nthe woman upturned to the wave above them, and then the billow broke,\nand nothing was seen but a sheet of frothy water. The boat and those in\nit had disappeared. For the crew I had little concern--I knew they would\ncome ashore safely enough; but for Mr. Bransome and the woman,\nwhoever she was, there was little hope. They had not had time to throw\nthemselves into the sea before the boat had capsized, and their clothing\nwould sink them in such a surf, even if they had escaped being crushed\nby the boat. Besides, I feared there had been some foul play on the part\nof Sooka. Quickly as he had done it, I had seen him with his oar put the\nboat beyond the possibility of escaping from the wave, and I remembered\nhow he had been treated by Bransome.\n\nWith such thoughts I ran along the cliff to the pathway that led down to\nthe beach; and as I ran, I saw Jackson running before me, not steadily\nor rightly, but heavily, and swaying from side to side as he went.\nQuickly I passed him, but he gave no sign that he knew any one was near\nhim; and as I leaped down on to the first ledge of rock below me, I saw\nthat he was not following me, but had disappeared among the brushwood.\n\nWhen I got down to the beach, I found that the boat’s crew had reached\nthe shore in safety, but of the two passengers nothing had been seen.\nThe capsized boat was sometimes visible as it lifted on the rollers,\nbut through my glass I saw that no one was clinging to it. I called for\nSooka, but Sooka was missing. Every one had seen him land, but he had\ndisappeared mysteriously. In vain I questioned the other boys as to the\ncause of the disaster. The only answer I could get out of them was an\nappeal to look to the sea and judge for myself. The woman was a\nwhite woman from the big ship, was all they could say about her; and,\nnegro-like, they evidently considered the loss of a woman or so of very\nlittle consequence.\n\nAll I could do was to set a watch along the beach to look for the bodies\nwhen they should be washed ashore, and this done, I returned to the\nfactory. My next desire was to find Sooka. He could hardly have gone\nfar, so I sent for a runner to take a message to the native king under\nwhose protection we on the Point were, and after whom the Point was\ncalled, and who was bound to find the missing man for me if he could, or\nif he had not been bribed to let him pass.\n\nIn my sorrow at what had happened, and in my doubt as to the cause of\nit, I had forgotten all about Jackson; but after I had despatched\nmy messenger to the king, I went to look for him. I discovered him\ncrouching in a corner of his own bedroom in the dark.\n\n“Are they found?” he asked, in a voice so hollow and broken that I\nhardly knew it; and before I could answer him, he whispered to himself,\n“No, no; they are drowned--drowned.”\n\nI tried to lead him into the lighted dining-room, but he only crouched\nthe closer to his corner. At length by the promise of the ever-potent\ntemptation, liquor, I got him to leave the room. He could scarcely walk,\nthough, now, and he trembled so violently that I was glad to give him\npart of a bottle of brandy that I had by me. He filled a tumbler half\nfull of the spirits, and drank it off. This put strength into him, and\nfor a little he was calm; but as he again and again applied himself to\nthe bottle, he became drunk, and swore at me for my impudence in giving\norders without his sanction. On this I tried to take the bottle from\nhim, but he clutched it so firmly that I had to let it go; whereupon he\nimmediately put it to his lips and swallowed the rest of the liquor that\nwas in it. After which he gave a chuckle, and staggered to a couch, on\nwhich he tumbled, and lay with his eyes open for a long while. At last\nhe fell asleep, but I was too nervous to do likewise, and sat watching\nhim the most of the night; at least, when I awoke it was daylight, and\nit seemed to me that I had been asleep for a few minutes.\n\nJackson was still lying on the couch, and his face was calm and peaceful\nas he softly breathed. The morning, too, was fine, and as I walked on to\nthe veranda I saw the sea sparkling in the sunlight, and there was not\na sound from it save a far-off and drowsy murmur. Not a sign remained\non its broad surface of the wrath of the day before. It was wonderfully\ncalm. Lying here and there on the veranda, rolled up in their clothes,\nwere the servants of the factory, sleeping soundly on the hard planks.\n\nPresently, as the sun rose in the heavens and warmed the air, the place\nbegan to show signs of life, and one of the watch that I had set on the\nbeach came running across the yard to tell me that the bodies had come\nashore.\n\nImmediately upon hearing this I called the hammock-bearers together,\nand going down to the beach, I went a considerable way along it toward\na dark spot, which I knew to be a group of natives. On coming up to the\ngroup, I found at least fifty negroes collected round the drowned man\nand woman, all chattering and squabbling among themselves, and probably\nover the plunder, for I saw that the bodies had been stripped to\ntheir underclothing. Rushing into the crowd, with the aid of a stick\nI dispersed it, so far as to make the wretches stand back. The man, of\ncourse, was Bransome, there was no doubt as to that, although he had\nreceived a terrible blow on the left temple, most likely from the\npointed stem of the boat as it had toppled over upon him, and his face\nwas distorted and twisted to one side. The woman was evidently English,\nyoung and pretty, although her long hair, heavy and wet, was polluted by\nthe sand that stuck to it, and her half-open eyes were filled with\nthe same. On her lips there lingered a slight smile. She was of middle\nheight, of slender figure, and delicately nurtured, as the small\nbare feet and little hands showed. As I looked at the latter I saw a\nwedding-ring on her finger, and I thought, “It is Bransome’s wife.” I\ntried to take the ring away, but it would not come off her finger--which\nI might have known, because the natives would not have left it there\nhad they been able to remove it. I then ordered the bearers to lay the\nbodies in the hammocks; and that done, our little party wended its way\nalong the shore homeward, while the natives I had dispersed followed one\nafter another in African fashion.\n\nArrived at the factory, I bade the boys place the bodies side by side on\na spare bed in an empty room, and then I sent them to dig a grave in the\nlittle burial-ground on the Point, where two or three worm-eaten wooden\ncrosses marked the resting-places of former agents of Messrs. Flint\nBrothers.\n\nAs quick interment was necessary in such a climate, even on that very\nday, I went to call Jackson in order that he might perform the duty\nthat was his--that of reading the burial service over the dead, and of\nsealing up the desk and effects of Mr. Bransome. But Jackson was not in\nthe factory. I guessed, however, where he was; and sure enough I found\nhim in his accustomed haunt at the end of the Point. The moment he saw\nme he tried to hide himself among the brushwood, but I was too quick for\nhim, and spied him as he crouched behind a dwarf palm.\n\n“I know, I know,” he cried, as I ran up to him; “I saw you come along\nthe beach. Bury them, bury them out of sight.”\n\n“Come, Mr. Jackson,” I replied, “it isn’t fair to put all the trouble on\nto me. I am sure I have had enough of the weariness and anxiety of this\nsad business. You must take your share of it. I want you to read the\nservice for the dead over them.”\n\n“No, no,” he almost shrieked; “bury them quick; never mind me. Put them\nout of sight.”\n\n“I will not,” I said, resolutely. “For your own sake you must, at any\nrate, view the bodies.”\n\n“They have not been murdered?” He replied. But the startled look with\nwhich I received the suggestion his words implied seemed to make him\nrecollect himself, for he rose and took my arm without saying more. As\nhe did so, I felt for the first time a sort of repugnance toward him.\nUp to that moment my feeling had been one of pity and anxiety on his\naccount, but now I loathed him. This he seemed instinctively to feel,\nand he clung closely to me.\n\nOnce at the factory I determined that there should be no more delay on\nhis part, and I took him to the door of the room where the bodies had\nbeen laid, but at it he made a sudden halt and would not enter. Covering\nhis face with his hands, he trembled violently as I pushed the door open\nand advanced to the bedside. The room, hushed and in semi-darkness; the\nwhite sheet, whose surface showed too plainly the forms beneath it;\nand the scared, terrified face of the man who, with brain afire,\nstood watching, with staring eyes, the bed, made a scene I have never\nforgotten.\n\nSlowly I turned down the upper part of the sheet, and Jackson, as if\nfascinated by the act, advanced a step or two into the room, but with\nface averted. Gradually he turned it toward the bodies, and for a moment\nhis gaze rested upon them. The next instant he staggered forward, looked\nat the woman’s face, panted for breath once or twice, and then, with\nuplifted hands and a wild cry of “Lucy!” fell his length upon the floor.\nWhen I stooped over him he was in convulsions, and dark matter was\noozing out of his mouth. The climax had come. I shouted for the\nservants, and they carried him to his own room, and placed him on his\nown bed.\n\nHow I got through that day I hardly know. Alone I buried Bransome\nand his wife, and alone I returned from the hurried task to watch by\nJackson’s bedside. None of the natives would stay near him. For two days\nhe lay unconscious. At the end of that time he seemed to have some idea\nof the outside world, for his eyes met mine with intelligence in their\nlook, and on bending over him I heard him whisper, “Forgive me!” Then\nhe relapsed into unconsciousness again. Through the long hours his eyes\nremained ever open and restless; he could not eat, nor did he sleep, and\nI was afraid he would pass away through weakness without a sign,\nbeing an old man. On the third day he became delirious, and commenced\nchattering and talking to himself, and imagining that all kinds of\nhorrid shapes and creatures were around and near him. I had to watch him\nnarrowly in order to prevent him stealing out of his bed, which he\nwas ready to do at any moment to avoid the tortures which he fearfully\nimagined awaited him. By these signs I knew that he was in the middle\nof an attack of delirium tremens, and I tried to quiet him by means of\nlaudanum, but it had no effect upon him. I got him, however, to swallow\na little soup, which sustained him. My own boy was the only negro I had\nbeen able to induce to stay in the room, and he would only remain in it\nwhile I was there.\n\nI had sent a messenger to the nearest station, where I remembered there\nwas a Portuguese doctor; but he had not returned by the evening of the\nfourth day. That night, worn out with watching, I had dozed off to sleep\non a chair placed by the sick man’s bed, when all at once I was awakened\nby a loud report, and I jumped up to find the room filled with smoke.\nAs it cleared away I saw that Jackson was standing in the middle of\nthe room with a revolver in his hand. As I confronted him he laughed a\ndevilish laugh and cocked the weapon, crying as he did so, “It was you\nwho tempted me with your smooth face and unsuspicious way, and you\nshall die, though I suffer doubly in hell for it. Hist!” and he stopped\nsuddenly and listened. “Don’t you hear the breakers? Hark, how they\nroar! They say they are ready, always ready,” and staring in front of\nhim, he advanced, as if following the sign of an invisible hand, to the\ndoor, unconsciously placing, to my infinite relief, the revolver on the\ntop of a chest of drawers as he passed by it. I did not dare to move,\nand he opened the door and walked into the front room. Then I followed\nhim. For a little he remained in the room, glaring vacantly about him,\nand muttering to himself; but seeing the outer door open he made a rush\ntoward it, and disappeared into the darkness of the night. Calling to\nthe boy, I ran after him, and easily came up to him, when he turned, and\npicking up a heavier stone than I thought he could have lifted, threw it\nat me. I dodged it and closed with him. Once in my arms I found I could\nhold him, and my servant and I carried him back into the factory. We\nplaced him on the floor of the dining-room, and he was too exhausted\nto move for a while. By degrees, however, he recovered sufficiently to\nstand; and as soon as he could do so by himself, with devilish cunning\nhe made for the lamp, which he struck, quick as lightning, with a stick\nthat had been lying on the table. In an instant the great round globe\nfell to pieces, but luckily the chimney was not broken, and the lamp\nremained alight, and before he could strike another blow at it I had\ngrappled with him again. This time he struggled violently for a few\nmoments, and seemed to think that he was dealing with Bransome, for he\nshrieked, “What! have you come back from the sea? You are wet! you are\nwet!” and shuddering, he tried to free himself from my hold; and I, not\nliking to hurt him, let him go, taking care to keep myself between him\nand the lamp.\n\n“Back from me, you villain of hell!” he cried, as soon as he was free.\n“What have you done with her? what have you done with her?” And then,\nin a tone of weird and pathetic sorrow, “Where is my little one that I\nloved? I have sought her many a year; oh, why did she forsake me? Aha,\nSooka! we were right to send him to the hell whence he came--the lying,\nfalse-hearted scoundrel, to steal away my white dove!”\n\nAfter which he drew from his finger a solid gold ring which he always\nwore, and threw it from him, saying, with a wild laugh, “There! that’s\nfor any one that likes it; I’m a dead man.” He then staggered toward his\nown room, and I, remembering the loaded revolver which still lay on\nthe chest of drawers, tried to intercept him. In his rage, for I verily\nbelieve that he also remembered that the weapon was there, he spat in my\nface, and struck me with all his force between the eyes; but I stuck to\nhim, and with the help of the boy, who had been all this time in hiding,\nbut who came forward at my call, I laid him for the last time upon his\nbed. There he lay exhausted for the remainder of the night; but there\nwas no rest for me; I felt that I had to watch him now for my own\nsafety.\n\nToward morning, however, his breathing became, all at once, very heavy\nand slow, and I bent over him in alarm. As I did so, I heard him\nsigh faintly, “Lucy!” and at that moment the native boy softly placed\nsomething upon the bed. I took it up. It was the ring the sick man had\nthrown away in the night, and as I looked at it I saw “James, from Lucy”\n engraved on its inside surface, and I knew that the dead woman was his\nwife.\n\nAs the first faint streaks of dawn stole into the room, the\nslow-drawn breathing of the dying man ceased. I listened--it came\nagain--once--twice--and then all was silence. He was dead, and I\nrealised in the sudden stillness that had come upon the room that I was\nalone. Yet he had passed away so quietly after his fitful fever that I\ncould not bring myself to believe that he was really gone, and I stood\nlooking at the body, fearing to convince myself of the truth by touching\nit.\n\nSo entranced was I by that feeling of awe which comes to almost every\none in the presence of death, that I did not hear the shouting of the\nhammock-boy outside, or the footsteps of a white man coming into\nthe room; and not until he touched me on the shoulder did I turn and\nrecognise the sallow face of the Portuguese doctor whom I had sent for,\nand who had thus arrived too late. However, he served to help me to bury\nthe mortal part of Jackson in the little graveyard beside the body of\nhis wife and that of the man who had come between them when alive. And\nsuch was without doubt the fact; for when the doctor had gone, and I\nwas alone again, I collected and made an inventory of the dead men’s\neffects, and in Jackson’s desk I found his diary, or, as he himself\nwould have called it, his log; and in that log was noted, on the very\nday that Bransome had arrived on the Point, his suspicion of the man,\nand later on his conviction that Bransome was indeed he who had injured\nhim.\n\nSooka was never found; but when the mail-steamer returned from the south\ncoast, I discovered that the younger patrao had made his crew row away\nsuddenly from the steamer’s side, while Mr. Bransome had been engaged\nbelow, and was out of sight. So it was evident that the pair had been in\nleague together to insure Sooka his revenge. What share Jackson had had\nin the murder of his enemy I did not care to think of, but feared the\nworst.\n\nFor myself, I had to remain on the Point for many months, until the\nfactory was finally closed--for no purchaser was ever found for it;\nand doubtless, by this time, the buildings are in ruins, and long grass\nhides the graves of those who sleep upon King Bemba’s Point.'),(11,'It was seven o\'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day\'s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips.
